<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>“The</span> Preface is the most troublesome part of a book,” I have
often heard my dear Father say; and now it falls to my
unaccustomed pen to write a preface for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot undertake to define the aim of this book; I can
only tell how the last work on it was done. In my Father’s
note-book I find it described as “A few carefully studied monographs,
linked together by a slender thread of ethnographic
relationship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Returning in June last from a brief visit to Montreal, with
the first signs of illness beginning to show, he found a bundle of
proofs waiting for him, and with the characteristic promptness
which never let any duty wait, he set to work at once to
correct them. “It is my last book,” he said, conscious that
his busy brain had nearly fulfilled all its tasks; and so
through days of rapidly increasing weakness and pain he lay
on the sofa correcting proofs till the pen dropped from the
hand no longer able to hold it. His mind turned to the
book in his <span class='it'>wandering</span> thoughts from illness, and on one of
these occasions he murmured: “Sybil will write the Preface”;
and so I try to fulfil his wish. “Ask Mr. Douglas to correct
the proofs himself, and to be sure to make an index,” was one
of his last requests, thus providing for the finishing of the
work which he could not himself finish. He has passed
now from this world whose prehistoric story he so lovingly
tried to decipher, and where he was ever finding traces of the
hand of God, into that other world, “where toil shall cease
and rest begin”; but where I doubt not he still goes on
learning more and more, no longer seeing through a glass darkly
but in perfect light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The silent lips seem to speak once more in this volume—his
last words to the public; and I commit it very

<div><span class='pageno' title='1' id='Page_1'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>THE LOST ATLANTIS</span><br/> I<br/> EARLY IDEAS</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> legend of Atlantis, an island-continent lying in the
Atlantic Ocean over against the Pillars of Hercules, which,
after being long the seat of a powerful empire, was engulfed
in the sea, has been made the basis of many extravagant
speculations; and anew awakens keenest interest with the
revolving centuries. The 12th of October 1892 has been
proclaimed a World’s holiday, to celebrate its accomplished
cycle of four centuries since Columbus set foot on the shores
of the West. The voyage has been characterised as the most
memorable in the annals of our race; and the century thus
completed is richer than all before it in the transformations
that the birth of time has disclosed since the wedding of the
New World to the Old. The story of the Lost Atlantis is
recorded in the <span class='it'>Timæus</span> and, with many fanciful amplifications,
in the <span class='it'>Critias</span> of Plato. According to the dialogues, as reproduced
there, Critias repeats to Socrates a story told him by
his grandfather, then an old man of ninety, when he himself
was not more than ten years of age. According to this narrative,
Solon visited the city of Sais, at the head of the
Egyptian delta, and there learned from the priests of the
ancient empire of Atlantis, and of its overthrow by a convulsion
of nature. “No one,” says Professor Jowett, in his
critical edition of <span class='it'>The Dialogues of Plato</span>, “knew better than
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>
Plato how to invent ‘a noble lie’ ”; and he, unhesitatingly,
pronounces the whole narrative a fabrication. “The world, like
a child, has readily, and for the most part, unhesitatingly
accepted the tale of the Island of Atlantis.” To the critical
editor, this reception furnishes only an illustration of popular
credulity, showing how the chance word of a poet or philosopher
may give rise to endless historical or religious speculation.
In the <span class='it'>Critias</span>, the legendary tale is unquestionably
expanded into details of no possible historical significance or
genuine antiquity. But it is not without reason, that men
like Humboldt have recognised in the original legend the
possible vestige of a widely-spread tradition of earliest times.
In this respect, at any rate, I purpose here to review it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is to be noted that even in the time of Socrates, and
indeed of the elder Critias, this Atlantis was referred to as
the vague and inconsistent tradition of a remote past; though
not more inconsistent than much else which the cultured
Greeks were accustomed to receive. Mr. Hyde Clarke, in an
“Examination of the Legend,” printed in the <span class='it'>Transactions of
the Royal Historical Society</span>, arrives at the conclusion that
Atlantis was the name of the king rather than of the dominion.
But king and kingdom have ever been liable to be referred to
under a common designation. According to the account in
the <span class='it'>Timæus</span>, Atlantis was a continent lying over against the
Pillars of Hercules, greater in extent than Libya and Asia
combined; the highway to other islands and to a great ocean,
of which the Mediterranean Sea was a mere harbour. But in
the vagueness of all geographical knowledge in the days of
Socrates and of Plato, this Atlantic domain is confused with
some Iberian or western African power, which is stated to
have been arrayed against Egypt, Hellas, and all the countries
bordering on the Mediterranean Sea. The knowledge even of
the western Mediterranean was then very imperfect; and, to
the ancient Greek, the West was a region of vague mystery
which sufficed for the localisation of all his fondest imaginings.
There, on the far horizon, Homer pictured the Elysian plain,
where, under a serene sky, the favourites of Zeus enjoyed
eternal felicity; Hesiod assigned the abode of departed heroes
to the Happy Isles beyond the western waters that engirdled
Europe; and Seneca foretold that that mysterious ocean would
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
yet disclose an unknown world which it then kept concealed.
To the ancients, Elysium ever lay beyond the setting sun; and
the Hesperia of the Greeks, as their geographical knowledge
increased, continued to recede before them into the unexplored
west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the youth of all nations, the poet and historian are one;
and, according to the tale of the elder Critias, the legend of
Atlantis was derived from a poetic chronicle of Solon, whom
he pronounced to have been one of the best of poets, as well
as the wisest of men. The elements of oral tradition are aptly
set forth in the dialogue which Plato puts into the mouth of
Timæus of Locris, a Pythagorean philosopher. Solon is
affirmed to have told the tale to his personal friend, Dropidas,
the great-grandfather of Critias, who repeated it to his son;
and he, eighty years thereafter, in extreme old age, told it to
his grandson, a boy of ten, whose narrative, reproduced in
mature years, we are supposed to read in the dialogue of the
<span class='it'>Timæus</span>. Even those are but the later links in the traditionary
catena. Solon himself visited Sais, a city of the
Egyptian delta, under the protection of the goddess, Neith or
Athene. There, when in converse with the Egyptian priests,
he learned, for the first time, rightly to appreciate how ignorant
of antiquity he and his countrymen were. “O Solon, Solon,”
said an aged priest to him, “you Hellenes are ever young, and
there is no old man who is a Hellene; there is no opinion or
tradition of knowledge among you which is white with age.”
Solon had told them the mythical tales of Phoroneus and
Niobe, and of Deucalion and Pyrrha, and had attempted to
reckon the interval by generations since the great deluge.
But the priest of Sais replied to this that such Hellenic annals
were children’s stories. Their memory went back but a little
way, and recalled only the latest of the great convulsions of
nature, by which revolutions in past ages had been wrought:
“The memory of them is lost, because there was no written
voice among you.” And so the venerable priest undertook to
tell him of the social life and condition of the primitive
Athenians 9000 years before. It is among the events of this
older era that the overthrow of Atlantis is told: a story
already “white with age” in the time of Socrates, 3400
years ago. The warriors of Athens, in that elder time, were
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
a distinct caste; and when the vast power of Atlantis was
marshalled against the Mediterranean nations, Athens bravely
repelled the invader, and gave liberty to the nations whose
safety had been imperilled; but in the convulsion that followed,
in which the island-continent was engulfed in the
ocean, the warrior race of Athens also perished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story, as it thus reaches us, is one of the vaguest of
popular legends, and has been transmitted to modern times in
the most obscure of all the writings of Plato. Nevertheless,
there is nothing improbable in the idea that it rests on some
historic basis, in which the tradition of the fall of an Iberian,
or other aggressive power in the western Mediterranean, is
mingled with other and equally vague traditions of intercourse
with a vast continent lying beyond the Pillars of Hercules.
Mr. Hyde Clarke, in his <span class='it'>Khita and Khita-Peruvian Epoch</span>,
draws attention to the ancient system of geography, alluded
to by various early writers, and notably mentioned by Crates
of Pergamos, <span class='sc'>b.c.</span> 160, which treated of the Four Worlds.
This he connects with the statement by Mr. George Smith,
derived from the cuneiform interpretations, that Agu, an
ancient king of Babylonia, called himself “King of the Four
Races.” He also assigns to it a relation with others, including
its Inca equivalent of <span class='it'>Tavintinsuzu</span>, the Empire of the Four
Quarters of the World. But the extravagance of regal titles
has been the same in widely diverse ages; so that much
caution is necessary before they can be made a safe basis for
comprehensive generalisations. Four kings made war against
five in the vale of Siddim; and when Lot was despoiled and
taken captive by Chederlaomer, King of Elam, Tidal, King of
Nations, and other regal allies, Abraham, with no further aid
than that of his trained servants, born in his house, three
hundred and eighteen in all, smote their combined hosts, and
recovered the captives and the spoil. Here, at least, it is
obvious that “the King of Nations” was somewhat on a par
with one of the six vassal kings who rowed King Edgar on
the River Dee. Certainly, within any early period of authentic
history, the conceptions of the known world were reduced
within narrow bounds; and it would be a very comprehensive
deduction from such slight premises as the legend supplies, to
refer it to an age of accurate geographical knowledge in which
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
the western hemisphere was known as one of four worlds,
or continents. When the Scottish poet, Dunbar, wrote of
America, twenty years after the voyage of Columbus, he only
knew of it as “the new-found isle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The opinion, universally favoured in the infancy of physical
science, of the recurrence of convulsions of nature, whereby
nations were revolutionised, and vast empires destroyed by fire,
or engulfed in the ocean, revived with the theories of cataclysmic
phenomena in the earlier speculations of modern
geology; and has even now its advocates among writers who
have given little heed to the concurrent opinion of later scientific
authorities. Among the most zealous advocates of the idea of
a submerged Atlantic continent, the seat of a civilisation older
than that of Europe, or of the old East, was the late Abbé
Brasseur de Bourbourg. As an indefatigable and enthusiastic
investigator, he occupies a place in the history of American
archæology somewhat akin to that of his fellow-countryman,
M. Boucher de Perthes, in relation to the palæontological disclosures
of Europe. He had the undoubted merit of first
drawing the attention of the learned world to the native transcripts
of Maya records, the full value of which is only now
being adequately recognised. His <span class='it'>Histoire des Nations Civilisées</span>
aims at demonstrating from their religious myths and historical
traditions the existence of a self-originated civilisation. In
his subsequent <span class='it'>Quatre Lettres sur le Mexique</span>, the Abbé adopted,
in the most literal form, the venerable legend of Atlantis,
giving free rein to his imagination in some very fanciful
speculations. He calls into being, “from the vasty deep,” a
submerged continent, or, rather, extension of the present
America, stretching eastward, and including, as he deems
probable, the Canary Islands, and other insular survivals of
the imaginary Atlantis. Such speculations of unregulated zeal
are unworthy of serious consideration. But it is not to be
wondered at that the vague legend, so temptingly set forth in
the <span class='it'>Timæus</span>, should have kindled the imaginations of a class
of theorists, who, like the enthusiastic Abbé, are restrained by
no doubts suggested by scientific indications. So far from
geology lending the slightest confirmation to the idea of an
engulfed Atlantis, Professor Wyville Thomson has shown, in
his <span class='it'>Depths of the Sea</span>, that while oscillations of the land have
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
considerably modified the boundaries of the Atlantic Ocean,
the geological age of its basin dates as far back, at least, as the
later Secondary period. The study of its animal life, as revealed
in dredging, strongly confirms this, disclosing an unbroken
continuity of life on the Atlantic sea-bed from the
Cretaceous period to the present time; and, as Sir Charles
Lyell has pointed out, in his <span class='it'>Principles of Geology</span>, the entire
evidence is adverse to the idea that the Canaries, the Madeiras,
and the Azores, are surviving fragments of a vast submerged
island, or continuous area of the adjacent continent. There
are, indeed, undoubted indications of volcanic action; but
they furnish evidence of local upheaval, not of the submergence
of extensive continental areas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is an easy, as well as a pleasant pastime, to evolve
either a camel or a continent out of the depths of one’s own
inner consciousness. To such fanciful speculators, the lost
Atlantis will ever offer a tempting basis on which to found
their unsubstantial creations. Mr. H. H. Bancroft, when
alluding to the subject in his <span class='it'>Native Races of the Pacific States</span>,
refers to forty-two different works for notices and speculations
concerning Atlantis. The latest advocacy of the idea of an
actual island-continent of the mid-Atlantic, literally engulfed
in the ocean, within a period authentically embraced
by historical tradition, is to be found in its most popular form
in Mr. Ignatius Donnelly’s <span class='it'>Atlantis, the Antediluvian World</span>.
By him, as by Abbé Brasseur, the concurrent opinions of the
highest authorities in science, that the main features of the
Atlantic basin have undergone no change within any recent
geological period, are wholly ignored. To those, therefore, who
attach any value to scientific evidence, such speculations present
no serious claims on their study. There is, indeed, an
idea favoured by certain students of science, who carry the
spirit of nationality into regions ordinarily regarded as lying
outside of any sectional pride, that, geologically speaking,
America is the older continent. It may at least be accepted
as beyond dispute, that that continent and the great Atlantic
basin intervening between it and Europe are alike of a geological
antiquity which places the age of either entirely apart
from all speculations affecting human history. But such fancies
are wholly superfluous. The idea of intercourse between
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
the Old and the New World prior to the fifteenth century,
passed from the region of speculation to the domain of historical
fact, when the publication of the <span class='it'>Antiquitates Americanæ</span> and
the <span class='it'>Grönland’s Historiske Mindesmærker</span>, by the antiquaries of
Copenhagen, adduced contemporary authorities, and indisputably
genuine runic inscriptions, in proof of the visits of the
Northmen to Greenland and the mainland of North America,
before the close of the tenth century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea of pre-Columbian intercourse between Europe and
America, is thus no novelty. What we have anew to consider
is: whether, in its wider aspect, it is more consistent with probability
than the revived notion of a continent engulfed in
the Atlantic Ocean? The earliest students of American antiquities
turned to Phœnicia, Egypt, or other old-world centres
of early civilisation, for the source of Mexican, Peruvian, and
Central American art or letters; and, indeed, so long as the
unity of the human race remained unquestioned, some theory
of a common source for the races of the Old and the New World
was inevitable. The idea, therefore, that the new world which
Columbus revealed, was none other than the long-lost Atlantis,
is one that has probably suggested itself independently to many
minds. References to America have, in like manner, been
sought for in obscure allusions of Herodotus, Seneca, Pliny,
and other classical writers, to islands or continents in the ocean
which extended beyond the western verge of the world as known
to them. That such allusions should be vague, was inevitable.
If they had any foundation in a knowledge by elder generations
of this western hemisphere, the tradition had come down
to them by the oral transmissions of centuries; while their
knowledge of their own eastern hemisphere was limited and
very imperfect. “The Cassiterides, from which tin is brought”—assumed
to be the British Isles,—were known to Herodotus
only as uncertainly located islands of the Atlantic of which he
had no direct information. When Assuryuchurabal, the founder
of the palace at Nimrud, conquered the people who lived on
the banks of the Orontes from the confines of Hamath to the
sea, the spoils obtained from them included one hundred talents
of <span class='it'>anna</span>, or tin; and the same prized metal is repeatedly
named in cuneiform inscriptions. The people trading in tin, supposed
to be identical with the Shirutana, were the merchants
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
of the world before Tyre assumed her place as chief
among the merchant princes of the sea. Yet already, in the
time of Joshua, she was known as “the strong city, Tyre.”
“Great Zidon” also is so named, along with her, when Joshua
defines the bounds of the tribe of Asher, extending to the sea
coast; and is celebrated by Homer for its works of art. The
Seleucia, or Cilicia, of the Greeks was an attempted restoration
of the ancient seaport of the Shirutana, which may have
been an emporium of Khita merchandise; as it was, undoubtedly,
an important place of shipment for the Phœnicians
in their overland trade from the valley of the Euphrates. One
favoured etymology of Britain, as the name of the islands whence
tin was brought, is <span class='it'>barat-anna</span>, assumed to have been applied to
them by that ancient race of merchant princes: the Cassiterides
being the later Aryan equivalent, Gr. κασσίτεροϛ, Sansk. <span class='it'>kastira</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In primitive centuries, when ancient maritime races thus
held supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea, voyages were undoubtedly
made far into the Atlantic Ocean. The Phœnicians,
who of all the nations settled on its shores lay among the
remotest from the outlying ocean, habitually traded with
settlements on the Atlantic. They colonised the western
shores of the Mediterranean at a remote period; occupied
numerous favourable trading-posts on the bays and headlands
of the Euxine, as well as of Sicily and others of the larger
islands; and passing beyond the straits, effected settlements
along the coasts of Europe and Africa. According to Strabo
(i. 48), they had factories beyond the Pillars of Hercules in
the period immediately succeeding the Trojan war: an era
which yearly becomes for us less mythical, and to which may
be assigned the great development of the commercial prosperity
of Tyre. The Phœnicians were then expanding their trading
enterprise, and extending explorations so as to command the
remotest available sources of wealth. The trade of Tarshish
was for Phœnicia what that of the East has been to England
in modern centuries. The Tartessus, on which the Arabs of
Spain subsequently conferred the name of the Guadalquivir,
afforded ready access to a rich mining district; and also
formed the centre of valuable fisheries of tunny and muræna.
By means of its navigable waters, along with those of the
Guadina, Phœnician traders were able to penetrate far inland;
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>
and the colonies established at their mouths furnished fresh
starting points for adventurous exploration along the Atlantic
seaboard. They derived much at least of the tin, which was
an important object of traffic, from the mines of north-west
Spain, and from Cornwall; though, doubtless, both the tin of
the Cassiterides and amber from the Baltic were also transported
by overland routes to the Adriatic and the mouth of
the Rhone. It was a Phœnician expedition which, in the
reign of Pharaoh Necho, <span class='sc'>b.c.</span> 611-605, after the decline of
that great maritime power, accomplished the feat of circumnavigating
Africa by way of the Red Sea. Hanno, a
Carthaginian, not only guided the Punic fleet round the
parts of Libya which border on the Atlantic, but has been
credited with reaching the Indian Ocean by the same route
as that which Vasco de Gama successfully followed in 1497.
The object of Hanno’s expedition, as stated in the <span class='it'>Periplus</span>,
was to found Liby-Phœnician cities beyond the Pillars of
Hercules. How far south his voyage actually extended along
the African coast is matter of conjecture, or of disputed interpretation;
for the original work is lost. It is sufficient for our
purpose to know that he did pursue the same route which led
in a later century to the discovery of Brazil. Aristotle applies
the name of “Antilla” to a Carthaginian discovery; and
Diodorus Siculus assigns to the Carthaginians the knowledge
of an island in the ocean, the secret of which they reserved to
themselves, as a refuge to which they could withdraw, should
fate ever compel them to desert their African homes. It is
far from improbable that we may identify this obscure island
with one of the Azores, which lie 800 miles from the coast
of Portugal. Neither Greek nor Roman writers make other
reference to them; but the discovery of numerous Carthaginian
coins at Corvo, the extreme north-westerly island of the group,
leaves little room to doubt that they were visited by Punic
voyagers. There is therefore nothing extravagant in the
assumption that we have here the “Antilla” mentioned by
Aristotle. While the Carthaginian oligarchy ruled, naval
adventure was still encouraged; but the maritime era of the
Mediterranean belongs to more ancient centuries. The Greeks
were inferior in enterprise to the Phœnicians; while the
Romans were essentially unmaritime; and the revival of the
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
old adventurous spirit with the rise of the Venetian and
Genoese republics was due to the infusion of fresh blood from
the great northern home of the sea-kings of the Baltic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The history of the ancient world is, for us, to a large
extent, the history of civilisation among the nations around
the Mediterranean Sea. Its name perpetuates the recognition
of it from remote times as the great inland sea which kept
apart and yet united, in intercourse and exchange of experience
and culture, the diverse branches of the human family settled
on its shores. Of the history of those nations, we only know
some later chapters. Disclosures of recent years have startled
us with recovered glimpses of the Khita, or Hittites, as a great
power centred between the Euphrates and the Orontes, but
extending into Asia Minor, and about <span class='sc'>b.c.</span> 1200 reaching
westward to the Ægean Sea. All but their name seemed to
have perished; and they were known only as one among
diverse Canaanitish tribes, believed to have been displaced by
the Hebrew inheritors of Palestine. Yet now, as Professor
Curtius has pointed out, we begin to recognise that “one of
the paths by which the art and civilisation of Babylonia and
Assyria made their way to Greece, was along the great high-road
which runs across Asia Minor”; and which the projected
railway route through the valley of the Euphrates seeks to
revive. For, as compared with Egypt, and the earliest nations
of Eastern Asia, the Greeks were, indeed, children. It was to
the Phœnicians that the ancients assigned the origin of navigation.
Their skill as seamen was the subject of admiration
even by the later Greeks, who owned themselves to be their
pupils in seamanship, and called the pole-star, the Phœnician
star. Their naval commerce is set forth in glowing rhetoric
by the prophet Ezekiel. “O Tyrus, thou that art situate at
the entry of the sea, a merchant of the people of many isles.
Thy borders are in the midst of the seas. The inhabitants
of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners. Thy wise men, O
Tyrus, were thy pilots. All the ships of the sea, with their
mariners, were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.” But this
was spoken at the close of Phœnician history, in the last days
of Tyre’s supremacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking back then into the dim dawn of actual history,
with whatever fresh light recent discoveries have thrown upon
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
it: this, at least, seems to claim recognition from us, that in
that remote era the eastern Mediterranean was a centre of
maritime enterprise, such as had no equal among the nations
of antiquity. Even in the decadence of Phœnicia, her maritime
skill remained unmatched. Egypt and Palestine, under their
greatest rulers, recognised her as mistress of the sea; and, as
has been already noted, the circumnavigation of Africa—which,
when it was repeated in the fifteenth century, was
considered an achievement fully equalling that of Columbus,—had
long before been accomplished by Phœnician mariners.
Carthage inherited the enterprise of the mother country, but
never equalled her achievements. With the fall of Carthage,
the Mediterranean became a mere Roman lake, over which the
galleys of Rome sailed reluctantly with her armed hosts; or
coasting along shore, they “committed themselves to the sea,
and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted up the mainsail to
the winds”; or again, “strake sail, and so were driven,” after
the blundering fashion described in the voyage of St. Paul.
To such a people, the memories of Punic exploration or
Phœnician enterprise, or the vague legends of an Atlantis
beyond the engirdling ocean, were equally unavailing. The
narrow sea between Gaul and Britain was barrier enough to
daunt the boldest of them from willingly encountering the
dangers of an expedition to what seemed to them literally
another world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing then that the first steps in navigation were taken in
an age lying beyond all memory, and that the oldest traditions
assign its origin to the remarkable people who figure alike in
early sacred and profane history—in Joshua and Ezekiel, in
Dius and Menander of Ephesus, in the Homeric poems and in
later Greek writings,—as unequalled in their enterprise on the
sea: what impediments existed in <span class='sc'>b.c.</span> 1400 or any earlier
century that did not still exist in <span class='sc'>a.d.</span> 1400, to render intercourse
between the eastern and the western hemisphere
impossible? America was no further off from Tarshish in
the golden age of Tyre than in that of Henry the Navigator.
With the aid of literary memorials of the race of sea-rovers
who carved out for themselves the Duchy of Normandy from
the domain of Charlemagne’s heir, and spoiled the Angles and
Saxons in their island home, we glean sufficient evidence to
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
place the fact beyond all doubt that, after discovering and
colonising Iceland and Greenland, they made their way southward
to Labrador, and so, some way along the American coast.
How far south their explorations actually extended, after being
long assigned to the locality of Rhode Island, has anew excited
interest, and is still a matter of controversy. The question is
reviewed on a subsequent page; but its final settlement does
not, in any degree, affect the present question. Certain it is
that, about <span class='sc'>a.d.</span> 1000, when St. Olaf was introducing Christianity
by a sufficiently high-handed process into the Norse
fatherland, Leif, the son of Eric, the founder of the first
Greenland colony, sailed from Ericsfiord, or other Greenland
port, in quest of southern lands already reported to have been
seen, and did land on more than one point of the North
American coast. We know what the ships of those Norse
rovers were: mere galleys, not larger than a good fishing
smack, and far inferior to it in deck and rigging. For compass
they had only the same old “Phœnician star,” which, from the
birth of navigation, had guided the mariners of the ancient
world over the pathless deep. The track pursued by the
Northmen, from Norway to Iceland, and so to Greenland and
the Labrador coast, was, doubtless, then as now, beset by fogs,
so that “neither sun nor stars in many days appeared”;
and they stood much more in need of compass than the
sailors of the “Santa Maria,” the “Pinta,” and the “Nina,”
the little fleet with which Columbus sailed from the Andalusian
port of Palos, to his first discovered land of “Guanahani,”
variously identified among the islands of the American Archipelago.
Yet, notwithstanding all the advantages of a southern
latitude, with its clearer skies, we have to remember that the
“Santa Maria,” the only decked vessel of the expedition, was
stranded; and the “Pinta” and “Nina,” on which Columbus
and his party had to depend for their homeward voyage, were
mere coasting craft, the one with a crew of thirty, and the
other with twenty-four men, with only <span class='it'>latine</span> sails. As to the
compass, we perceive how little that availed, on recalling the
fact that the Portuguese admiral, Pedro Alvares de Cabral,
only eight years later, when following on the route of Vasco de
Gama, was carried by the equatorial current so far out of his
intended course that he found himself in sight of a strange
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
land, in 10° S. lat., and so accidentally discovered Brazil and the
new world of the west, not by means of the mariner’s compass,
but in spite of its guidance. It is thus obvious that the
discovery of America would have followed as a result of the
voyage of Vasco de Gama round the Cape, wholly independent
of that of Columbus. What befell the Portuguese admiral of
King Manoel, in <span class='sc'>a.d.</span> 1500, was an experience that might just
as readily have fallen to the lot of the Phœnician admiral of
Pharaoh Necho in <span class='sc'>b.c.</span> 600, to the Punic Hanno, or other early
navigators; and may have repeatedly occurred to Mediterranean
adventurers on the Atlantic in older centuries. On the news
of de Cabral’s discovery reaching Portugal, the King despatched
the Florentine, Amerigo Vespucci, who explored the coast of
South America, prepared a map of the new-found world, and
thereby wrested from Columbus the honour of giving his name
to the continent which he discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we turn from the myths and traditions of the Old
World to those of the New, we find there traces that seem not
unfairly interpretable into the American counterpart of the
legend of Atlantis. The chief seat of the highest native
American civilisation, is neither Mexico nor Peru, but Central
America. The nations of the Maya stock, who inhabit
Yucatan, Guatemala, and the neighbouring region, were
peculiarly favourably situated; and they appear to have
achieved the greatest progress among the communities of
Central America. They may not unfitly compare with the
ancient dwellers in the valley of the Euphrates, from the grave
mounds of whose buried cities we are now recovering the
history of ages that had passed into oblivion before the Father
of History assumed the pen. Tested indeed by intervening
centuries their monuments are not so venerable; but, for
America’s chroniclings, they are more prehistoric than the
disclosures of Assyrian mounds. The cities of Central
America were large and populous, and adorned with edifices,
even now magnificent in their ruins. Still more, the Mayas
were a lettered people, who, like the Egyptians, recorded in
elaborate sculptured hieroglyphics the formulæ of history and
creed. Like them, too, they wrote and ciphered; and appear,
indeed, to have employed a comprehensive system of computing
time and recording dates, which, it cannot be doubted, will be
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
sufficiently mastered to admit of the decipherment of their
ancient records. The Mayas appear, soon after the Spanish
Conquest, to have adopted the Roman alphabet, and employed
it in recording their own historical traditions and religious
myths, as well as in rendering into such written characters
some of the ancient national documents. Those versions of
native myth and history survive, and attention is now being
directed to them. The most recent contribution from this
source is <span class='it'>The Annals of the Cakchiquels</span>, by Dr. D. G. Brinton,
a carefully edited and annotated translation of a native legal
document or <span class='it'>titulo</span>, in which, soon after the Conquest, the heir
of an ancient Maya family set forth the evidence of his claim
to the inheritance. Along with this may be noted another
work of the same class: <span class='it'>Titre Généalogique des Seigneurs de
Totonicapan. Traduit de l’Espagnol par M. de Charencey.</span>
These two works independently illustrate the same great
national event. In one, a prince of the Cakchiquel nation, tells
of the overthrow of the Quiché power by his people; and in
the other a Quiché seignior, one of the “Lords of Totonicapan,”
describes it from his own point of view. Both were of the
same Maya stock, in what is now the State of Guatemala.
Each nation had a capital adorned with temples and palaces,
the splendour of which excited the wonder of the Spaniards;
and both preserved traditions of the migration of their ancestors
from Tula, a mythical land from which they came across the
water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such traditions of migration meet us on many sides.
Captain Cook found among the mythological traditions of
Tahiti, a vague legend of a ship that came out of the ocean,
and seemed to be the dim record of ancestral intercourse with
the outer world. So also, the Aztecs had the tradition of the
golden age of Anahuac; and of Quetzalcoatl, their instructor
in agriculture, metallurgy and the arts of government. He
was of fair complexion, with long dark hair, and flowing beard:
all, characteristics foreign to their race. When his mission
was completed, he set sail for the mysterious shores of
Tlapallan; and on the appearance of the ships of Cortes, the
Spaniards were believed to have returned with the divine
instructor of their forefathers, from the source of the rising
sun.
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>What tradition hints at, physiology confirms. The races
of America differ less in physical character from those of Asia,
than do the races either of Africa or Europe. The American
Indian is a Mongol; and though marked diversities are traceable
throughout the American continent, the range of variation
is much less than in the eastern hemisphere. The western
continent appears to have been peopled by repeated migrations
and by diverse routes; but when we attempt to estimate any
probable date for its primeval settlement, evidence wholly
fails. Language proves elsewhere a safe guide. It has
established beyond question some long-forgotten relationship
between the Aryans of India and Persia and those of Europe; it
connects the Finn and Lapp with their Asiatic forefathers; it
marks the independent origin of the Basques and their priority
to the oldest Aryan intruders; it links together widely diverse
branches of the great Semitic family. Can language tell us of
any such American affinities, or of traces of Old World congeners,
in relation to either civilised Mayas and Peruvians, or
to the forest and prairie races of the northern continent?</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the millions of America’s coloured population, of
African blood and yet speaking Aryan languages, the American
comparative philologist can scarcely miss the significance
of the warning that linguistic and ethnical classifications by no
means necessarily imply the same thing. Nevertheless, without
overlooking this distinction, the ethnical significance of the
evidence which comparative philology supplies cannot be
slighted in any question relative to prehistoric relations
between the Old World and the New. What then can philology
tell us? There is one answer, at the least, which the
languages of America give, that fully accords with the legend,
“white with age,” that told of an island-continent in the
Atlantic Ocean with which the nations around the Mediterranean
once held intercourse. None of them indicates any
trace of immigration within the period of earliest authentic
history. Those who attach significance to the references in
the <span class='it'>Timæus</span> to political relations common to Atlantis and
parts of Libya and Europe; or who, on other grounds, look
with favour on the idea of early intercourse between the
Mediterranean and the western continent, have naturally
turned to the Eskuara of the Basques. It is invariably
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
recognised as the surviving representative of languages spoken
by the Allophyliæ of Europe before the intrusion of Aryans.
The forms of its grammar differ widely from those of any
Semitic, or Indo-European tongue, placing it in the same class
with Mongol, East African, and American languages. Here,
therefore, is a tempting glimpse of possible affinities; and
Professor Whitney, accordingly, remarks in his <span class='it'>Life and Growth
of Languages</span>, that the Basque “forms a suitable stepping-stone
from which to enter the peculiar linguistic domain of the New
World, since there is no other dialect of the Old World which
so much resembles in structure the American languages.” But
this glimpse of possible relationship has proved, thus far,
illusory. In their morphological character, certain American
and Asiatic languages have a common agglutinative structure,
which in the former is developed into their characteristic
polysynthetic attribute. With this, the Eskuarian system of
affixes corresponds. But beyond the general structure, there
is no such evidence of affinity, either in the vocabularies or
grammar, as direct affiliation might be expected to show.
Elements common to the Anglo-American of the nineteenth
century and the Sanskrit-speaking race beyond the Indus, in
the era of Alexander of Macedon, are suggested at once by the
grammatical structure of their languages; whereas there is
nothing in the resemblance between the Basque and any of
the North American languages that is not compatible with a
“stepping-stone” from Asia to America by the islands of the
Pacific. The most important of all the native American
languages in their bearing on this interesting inquiry—those
of Central America,—are only now receiving adequate attention.
Startling evidence may yet reward the diligence of students;
but, so far as language furnishes any clue to affinity of race,
no American language thus far discloses such a relationship,
as, for example, enabled Dr. Pritchard to suggest that the
western people of Europe, to whom the Greeks gave the
collective name of Kέλται, and whose languages had been
assumed by all previous ethnologists as furnishing evidence
that they were precursors of the Aryan immigrants, in reality
justified their classification in the same stock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while thus far, the evidence of language is, at best,
vague and indefinite in its response to the inquiry for proofs
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
of relationship of the races of America to those of the Old
World; physiological comparisons lend no confirmation to the
idea of an indigenous native race, with special affinities and
adaptation to its peculiar environment, and with languages all
of one class, the ramifications from a single native stem. So
far as physical affinities can be relied upon, the man of
America, in all his most characteristic racial diversities, is of
Asiatic origin. His near approximation to the Asiatic Mongol
is so manifest as to have led observers of widely different
opinions in all other respects, to concur in classing both under
the same great division: the Mongolian of Pickering, the
American Mongolidæ of Latham, the Mongoloid of Huxley.
Professor Flower, in an able discussion of the varieties of the
human species, addressed to the Anthropological Institute of
Great Britain in 1885, unhesitatingly classes the Eskimo as
the typical North Asiatic Mongol. In other American races
he notes as distinctive features the characteristic form of the
nasal bones, the well-developed superciliary ridge, and retreating
forehead; but the resemblance is so obvious in
many other respects, that he finally includes them all
among the members of the Mongolian type. If, then,
the American Mongol came originally from Asia, or
sprung from the common stock of which the Asiatic
Mongol is the typical representative, within any such
period as even earliest Phœnician history would embrace,
much more definite traces of affinity are to be looked
for in his language than mere correspondence in the
agglutination characteristic of a very widely diffused
class of speech. But we, thus far, look in vain
for traces of a common genealogy such as those which, on
the one hand, correlate the Semitic and Aryan families of
Asia and Europe with parent stocks of times anterior to
history, and on the other, with ramifications of modern
centuries. We have, moreover, to deal mainly with the
languages of uncivilised races. To the continent north of the
Gulf of Mexico, the grand civilising art of the metallurgist
remained to the last unknown; and in Mexico, it appears as a
gift of recent origin, derived from Central America. The
Asiatic origin of the art of Tubal-cain has, indeed, been pretty
generally assumed, both for Central and Southern America;
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
but by mere inference. In doing so, we are carried back to
some mythic Quetzalcoatl: for neither the metallurgist nor
his art was introduced in recent centuries. Assuming, for the
sake of argument, the dispersion of a common population of
Asia and America, already familiar with the working of metals,
and with architecture, sculpture and other kindred arts, at a
date coeval with the founding of Tyre, “the daughter of Sidon,”
what help does language give us in favour of such a postulate?
We have great language groups, such as the Huron-Iroquois,
extending of old from the St. Lawrence to North Carolina;
the Algonkin, from Hudson Bay to South Carolina; the
Dakotan, from the Mississippi to the Rocky Mountains; the
Athabascan, from the Eskimo frontier, within the Arctic circle,
to New Mexico; and the Tinné family of languages west of the
Rocky Mountains, from the Youkon and Mackenzie rivers, far
south on the Pacific slope. With those, as with the more cultured
languages, or rather languages of the more cultured races, of
Central and Southern America, elaborate comparisons have
been made with vocabularies of Asiatic languages; but the
results are, at best, vague. Curious points of agreement have,
indeed, been demonstrated, inviting to further research; but
as yet the evidence of relationship mainly rests on correspondence
in structure. The agglutinative suffixes are common
to the Eskimo and many American Indian tongues. Dr. H.
Rink describes the polysynthetic process in the Eskimo language
as founded on radical words, to which additional or imperfect
words, or affixes, are attached; and on the inflexion, which, for
transitive verbs, indicates subject as well as object, likewise by
addition. But, while Professor Flower unhesitatingly characterises
the Eskimo as belonging to the typical North Asiatic
Mongols; he, at the same time, speaks of them as almost as
perfectly isolated in their Arctic home “as an island population.”
Nevertheless, the same structure is common to their
language and to those of the great North American families
already named. All alike present, in an exaggerated form, the
characteristic structure of the Ural-Altaic or Turanian group of
Asiatic languages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Race-type corresponds in the Old and New World. A
comparison of languages by means of the vocabularies of the
two continents, yields no such correspondence. All the more,
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
therefore, is the American student of comparative philology
stimulated to investigate the significance of the polysynthetic
characteristic found to pertain to so many—though by no
means to all—of the languages of this continent. The
relationship which it suggests to the agglutinative languages
of Asia, furnishes a subject of investigation not less interesting
to American students, alike of the science of language, and
of the whole comprehensive questions which anthropology
embraces, than the relations of the Romance languages of
Europe to the parent Latin; or of Latin itself, and all the
Aryan languages, ancient and modern, not only to Sanskrit
and Zend, but to the indeterminate stock which furnished the
parent roots, the grammatical forms, and that whole class of
words still recognisable as the common property of the whole
Aryan family. Sanskrit was a dead language three thousand
years ago; the English language, as such, cannot claim to
have endured much more than fourteen centuries, yet both
partake of the same common property of numerals and familiar
terms existing under certain modifications in Sanskrit, Greek,
Latin, Slavonic, Celtic, German, Anglo-Saxon, and in all the
Romance languages. Thus far the American philologist has
been unable to show any such genealogical relationship pervading
the native languages; or to recover specific evidence
of affinities to languages, and so to races of other continents.
There are, indeed, linguistic families, such as some already
referred to, indicating a common descent among widely dispersed
tribes; but this has its chief interest in relation to
another aspect of the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Max Müller has drawn attention to the tendency
of the languages of America towards an endless multiplication
of distinct dialects. Those again have been grouped by the
synthetic process of Hervas into eleven families: seven for the
northern continent, and four for South America. But we are
as yet only on the threshold of this important branch of
research. In two papers contributed by M. Lucien Adam to
the <span class='it'>Congrès International des Americanistes</span>, he gives the
results of a careful examination of sixteen languages of North
and South America; and arrives at the conclusion that they
belong to a number of independent families as essentially
distinct as they would have been “had there been primitively
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
several human pairs.” Dr. Brinton, one of the highest
authorities on any question connected with native American
languages, contributed a paper to the <span class='it'>American Antiquarian</span>
(Jan. 1886), “On the Study of the Nahuatl Language.” This
language, which is popularly known as Aztec, he strongly
commends to the study of American philologists. It is one
of the most completely organised of Indian languages, has
a literature of considerable extent and variety, and is still in
use by upwards of half a million of people. It is from this
area, southward through Central America, and in the great
seat of native South American civilisation, that we can alone
hope to recover direct evidence of ancient intercourse between
the Old and the New World. But, here again, the complexities
of language seem to grow apace. In Dr. Brinton’s <span class='it'>Notes on
the Mangue, an extinct Language formerly spoken in Nicaragua</span>,
he states, as a result of his later studies, that the belief
which he once entertained of some possible connection between
this dialect and the Aymara of Peru, has not been confirmed
on further examination. This, therefore, tends to sustain the
prevailing opinion of scholars that there is no direct affiliation
between the languages of North and South America. All this
is suggestive either of an idea, such as that which Agassiz
favoured in his system of natural provinces of the animal
world, in relation to different types of man, on which he
based the conclusion that the diverse varieties of American
man originated in various centres, and had been distributed
from them over the entire continent; or we must assume
immigration from different foreign centres. Accepting the
latter as the more tenable proposition, I long ago sketched
a scheme of immigration such as seemed to harmonise with
the suggestive, though imperfect evidence. This assumed the
earliest current of population, in its progress from a supposed
Asiatic cradleland, to have spread through the islands of the
Pacific, and reached the South American continent before any
excess of population had diffused itself into the inhospitable
northern steppes of Asia. By an Atlantic oceanic migration,
another wave of population occupied the Canaries, Madeiras,
and the Azores, and so passed to the Antilles, Central America,
and probably by the Cape Verdes, or, guided by the more
southern equatorial current, to Brazil. Latest of all, Behring
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
Strait and the North Pacific Islands may have become the
highway for a migration by which certain striking diversities
among nations of the northern continent, including the conquerors
of the Mexican plateau, are most easily accounted
for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not necessary to include in the question here discussed,
the more comprehensive one of the existence of man
in America contemporary with the great extinct animals of the
Quaternary Period; though the acknowledged affinities of
Asiatic and American anthropology, taken in connection with
the remoteness of any assignable period for migration from Asia
to the American continent, renders it far from improbable that
the latest oscillations of land may here also have exercised an
influence. The present soundings of Behring Strait, and the
bed of the sea extending southward to the Aleutian Islands,
entirely accord with the assumption of a former continuity of
land between Asia and America. The idea to which the
speculations of Darwin, founded on his observations during the
voyage of the ‘Beagle’ gave rise, of a continuous subsidence
of the Pacific Ocean, also favoured the probability of greater
insular facilities for trans-oceanic migration at the supposed
period of the peopling of America from Asia. But more
recent explorations, and especially those connected with the
‘Challenger’ expedition, fail to confirm the old theory of the
origin of the coral islands of the Pacific; and in any view of
the case, we must be content to study the history of existing
races, alike of Europe and America, apart from questions
relating to palæocosmic man. If the vague legend of the
lost Atlantis embodies any trace of remotest historical tradition,
it belongs to a modern era compared with the men either
of the European drift, or of the post-glacial deposits of the
Delaware and the auriferous gravels of California. When resort
is had to comparative philology, it is manifest that we must be
content to deal with a more recent era than contemporaries of
the Mastodon, and their congeners of Europe’s Mammoth and
Reindeer periods, notwithstanding the fact that the modern
representatives of the latter have been sought within the
American Arctic circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such evidence as a comparison of languages thus far
supplies, lends more countenance to the idea of migration
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
through the islands of the Pacific, than to such a route from
the Mediterranean as is implied in any significance attached
to the legend of Atlantis. As to the Behring Strait route,
present ethnology and philology point rather to an overflow
of Arctic American population into Asia. Gallatin was the
first to draw attention to certain analogies in the structure of
Polynesian and American languages, as deserving of investigation;
and pointed out the peculiar mode of expressing the
tense, mood, and voice of the verb, by affixed particles, and
the value given to place over time, as indicated in the predominant
locative verbal form. Such are to be looked for
with greater probability among the languages of South America;
but the substitution of affixed particles for inflections, especially
in expressing the direction of action in relation to the speaker,
is common to the Polynesian and the Oregon languages, and
has analogies in the Cherokee. The distinction between the
inclusive and exclusive pronoun <span class='it'>we</span>, according as it means
“you and I,” or “they and I,” etc., is as characteristic of the
Maori as of the Ojibway. Other observations of more recent
date have still further tended to countenance the recognition of
elements common to the languages of Polynesia and America;
and so to point to migration by the Pacific to the western
continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this idea of a migration through the islands of the
Pacific receives curious confirmation from another source. In
an ingenious paper on “The Origin of Primitive Money,”<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a>
originally read at the meeting of the British Association at
Montreal in 1884, Mr. Horatio Hale shows that there is good
reason for believing that the most ancient currency in China
consisted of disks and slips of tortoise shell. The fact is stated
in the great Chinese encyclopædia of the Emperor Kang-he,
who reigned in the early years of the eighteenth century; and
the Chinese annalists assert that metal coins have been in use
from the time of Fuh-he, about <span class='sc'>b.c.</span> 2950. Without attempting
to determine the specific accuracy of Chinese chronology,
it is sufficient to note here that the most ancient form of
Chinese copper cash is the disk, perforated with a square hole,
so as to admit of the coins being strung together. This, which
corresponds in form to the large perforated shell-disks, or native
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
currency of the Indians of California, and with specimens
recovered from ancient mounds, Mr. Hale regards as the later
imitation in metal of the original Chinese shell money. A
similar shell-currency, as he shows, is in use among many
islanders of the Pacific; and he traces it from the Loo-Choo
Islands, across the vast archipelago, through many island
groups, to California; and then overland, with the aid of
numerous disclosures from ancient mounds, to the Atlantic
coast, where the Indians of Long Island were long noted for
its manufacture in the later form of wampum. “The natives
of Micronesia,” says Mr. Hale, who, it will be remembered,
records the results of personal observation, “in character,
usages, and language, resemble to a certain extent the nations
of the southern and eastern Pacific groups, which are included
in the designation of Polynesia, but with some striking differences,
which careful observers have ascribed, with great probability,
to influences from north-eastern Asia. They are noted
for their skill in navigation. They have well-rigged vessels,
exceeding sixty feet in length. They sail by the stars, and
are accustomed to take long voyages.” To such voyagers, the
Pacific presents no more formidable impediments to oceanic
enterprise than did the Atlantic to the Northmen of the tenth
century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the same archipelago, modern exploration is
rendering us familiar with examples of remarkable stone
structures and colossal sculptured figures, such as those from
Easter Island now in the British Museum. Rude as they
undoubtedly are, they are highly suggestive of an affinity to
the megalithic sculptures and cyclopean masonry of Peru.
Monuments of this class were noted long ago by Captain
Beechy on some of the islands nearest the coasts of Chili and
Peru. Since then the megalithic area has been extended by
their discovery in other island groups lying towards the continent
of Asia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another subsidiary class of evidence of a different kind,
long since noted by me, gives additional confirmation to this
recovered trail of ancient migration through the islands of the
Pacific to the American continent. The practice to which the
Flathead Indians of Oregon and British Columbia owe their
name, the compressed skulls from Peruvian cemeteries, and the
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
widely diffused evidence of the prevalence of such artificial
malformation among many American tribes, combine to indicate
it as one of the most characteristic American customs.
Yet the evidence is abundant which shows it not only as a
practice among rude Asiatic Mongol tribes of primitive centuries;
but proves that it was still in use among the Huns and
Avars who contended with the Barbarians from the Baltic for
the spoils of the decaying Roman empire. Nor was it merely
common to tribes of both continents. It furnishes another
link in the chain of evidence of ancient migration from Asia
to America; as is proved by its practice in some of the islands
of the Pacific, as described by Dr. Pickering,<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> and since
abundantly confirmed by the forms of Kanaka skulls. By
following up the traces of this strange custom, perpetuated
among the tribes on the Pacific coasts both of Northern and
Southern America to our own day, we thus once more retrace
the steps of ancient wanderers, and are carried back to centuries
when the Macrocephali of the Euxine attracted the observant
eye of Hippocrates, and became familiar to Strabo, Pliny, and

<p class='pindent'>But the wanderings among the insular races of the Pacific
are not limited to such remote eras. Later changes are also
recorded by other evidence. The direct relationship of existing
Polynesian languages is not Mongol but Malay; but this is
the intrusive element of a time long subsequent to the growth
of characteristic features which still perpetuate traces of Polynesian
and American affinities. The number and diversity of
the languages of the continent of America, and their essentially
native vocabularies, prove that the latter have been in prolonged
process of development, free from contact with languages
which appear to have been still modelling themselves according
to the same plan of thought in many scattered islands of the
Pacific.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remarkable amount of culture in the languages of some
of the barbarous nations of North America, traceable, apparently,
to the important part which the orator played in their
deliberative assemblies, has not unnaturally excited surprise:
but in any attempt to recover the history of the New World by
the aid of philology we must deal with the languages of its
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
civilised races. Among those the Nahuatl or Aztec has been
appealed to; and the Mayas have been noted as a lettered
people whose hieroglyphic records, and later transcripts of
written documents, are now the object of intelligent investigation
both by European and American philologists. The Maya
language strikingly contrasts, in its soft, vocalic forms, with
the languages of nations immediately to the north of its native
area. It is that which, according to Stephens, was affirmed to
be still spoken by a living race in a region beyond the Great
Sierra, extending to Yucatan and the Mexican Gulf. Others
among the cultured native languages which seem to invite
special study are the Aymara and the Quichua. Of these, the
latter was the classical language of South America, wherein,
according to its native historians, the Peruvian chroniclers and
poets incorporated the national legends. It may be described
as having occupied a place under Inca rule analogous to that
of the Norman French in England from the eleventh to the
thirteenth century. To those ancient, cultured languages of
the seats of an indigenous civilisation, and with a literature
of their own, attention is now happily directed. The students
of American ethnology begin to realise that the buried mounds
of Assyria are not richer in discoveries relative to the ancient
history of Asia than are the monuments, the hieroglyphic
records, and the languages of Central America and Peru, in
relation to a native social life which long flourished as a product
of their own West. To this occidental Assyria we have
to look for an answer to many inquiries, especially interesting
to the intrusive occupants of the western continent. If its
architecture and sculpture, and the hieroglyphic records with
which they are enriched, are modifications of a prehistoric
Asiatic civilisation, it is here that the evidence is to be looked
for; and if the arts of the sculptor and architect were brought
to the continent of America by wanderers from an Asiatic
fatherland, then those of the potter and of the metallurgist will
also prove to be an inheritance from the old Asiatic hive of
the nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the evidence thus far adduced it appears that ethnically
the American is Mongol, and by the agglutinative
element in many of the native languages may be classed as
Turanian. The Finnic hypothesis of Rask, however much
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
modified by later reconsideration of the question of the origin of
the Aryans, as well as the European melanochroic Metis of
Huxley, pertains to a prehistoric era of which the Finns and
the Basques are assumed to be survivals; and to that elder
era, rather than to any date within the remotest limits of
authentic history, the languages of America seem to refer us
in the search for any common origin with those of the eastern
hemisphere. But a zealous comparative philologist, already
referred to, has sought for linguistic traces of relationship
between the Old and the New World which, if confirmed,
would better harmonise with the traditions of intercourse
between the maritime nations of the eastern Mediterranean
and a continent lying outside of the Pillars of Hercules. In
his investigations he aims at determining the relations of the
Aztec or Nahuatl culture and language to those of Asia.
Humboldt long ago claimed for much of the former an Old
World derivation. It seems premature to attempt to deduce
any comprehensive results from the meagre data thus far
gathered. But the author of <span class='it'>The Khita and Khita-Peruvian
Epoch</span>, in tracing the progress of his Sumerian race, assigns
an interval of 4000 years since their settlement in
Babylonia and India. In like manner, on the assumption of
their migration from a common Asiatic centre, which the
division of Western and Eastern Sumerian in pronouns and
other details is thought to indicate, Peru, it is conceived, may
have been reached by a migratory wave of earlier movement,
from 4000 to 5000 years ago. Mr. Hyde Clarke indeed
conceives that it is quite within compass that the same great
wave of migration which passed over India and Babylonia,
continued to propagate its centrifugal force, and that by its
means Peru was reached within the last 3000 years.
But, whatever intercourse may possibly have then been carried
on between the Old and the New World, it must be obvious,
on mature reflection, that so recent a date for the peopling of
South America from Asia is as little reconcilable with the very
remote traces of linguistic affinity thus far adduced, as it is
with any fancied relationship with a lost Atlantis of the elder
world. The enduring affinities of long-parted languages
of the Old World tell a very different tale. With the
comparative philologist, as with the archæologist, time is
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
more and more coming to be recognised as an all-important
factor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, leaving the estimate of centuries out of consideration,
in the researches into the origin of the peculiar native civilisation
of America here referred to, the recently deciphered
Akkad is accepted as the typical language of the Sumerian
class. This is assumed to have started from High Asia, and
to have passed on to Babylonia; while another branch diffused
itself by India and Indo-China, and thence, by way of the
islands of the Pacific, reached America. Hence, in an illustrative
table of Sumerian words arranged under four heads, as
Western, Indo-Chinese, Peruvian, and Mexican, etc., it is noted
that “while in some cases a root may be traced throughout, it
will be seen that more commonly the western and American
roots or types, cross in the Indo-Chinese region.” But another
and older influence, related to the Agaw of the Nile region, is
also traced in the Guarani, Omagua, and other languages of
South America, indicating evidences of more remote relations
with the Old World, and with the African continent. This is
supposed to have been displaced by a Sumerian migration by
which the Aymara domination was established in Peru, and
the Maya element introduced into Yucatan. Those movements
are assumed to belong to an era of civilisation, during which
the maritime enterprise of the Pacific may have been carried
on upon a scale unknown to the most adventurous of modern
Malay navigators, notwithstanding the essentially maritime
character by which the race is still distinguished. All this
implies that the highway to the Pacific was familiar to both
continents; and hence a second migration is recognised, in
certain linguistic relations, between the Siamese and other
languages of Indo-China, and the Quichua and Aztec of Peru
and Mexico. But the problem of the origin of the races of
the western continent, and of the sources of its native civilisation,
is still in that preliminary stage in which the accumulation
of materials on which future induction may be based is of
more value than the most comprehensive generalisations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vastness of the American twin continents, with their
Atlantic and Pacific seaboard reaching from the Arctic well-nigh
to the Antarctic circle, furnishes a tempting stimulus to
theories of migration on the grandest scale, and to the assumption
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
of comprehensive schemes of international relation in
prehistoric centuries. But they are not more substantial than
the old legend of Atlantis. The best that can be said of them
is that here, at any rate, are lines of research in the prosecution
of which American ethnologists may employ their learning
and acumen encouraged by the hope of yet revealing a past
not less marvellous, and possessing a more personal interest,
than all which geology has recovered from the testimony of
the rocks. But before such can be more than dimly guessed
at, the patient diligence of many students will be needed to
accumulate the needful materials. Nor can we afford to delay
the task. The Narraganset Bible, the work of Eliot, the
apostle of the Indians, is the memorial of a race that has
perished; while other nations and languages have disappeared
since his day, with no such invaluable record of their character.
Mr. Horatio Hale published in the <span class='it'>Proceedings of the American
Philosophical Society</span>, in 1883, a paper on the “Tutelo Tribe
and Language,” derived from Nikonha, the last survivor of a
once powerful tribe of North Carolina. To Dr. Brinton, we
owe the recent valuable notes on the Mangue, another extinct
language. On the North-western Canadian prairies the buffalo
has disappeared, and the Indian must follow. On all hands,
we are called upon to work diligently while it is yet time, in
order to accumulate the materials out of which the history of
the western hemisphere is to be evolved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It accords with the idea of Polynesian genealogy, that
indications suggestive of grammatical affinity have been noted
in languages of South America, in their mode of expressing the
tense of the verb; in the formation of causative, reciprocal,
potential, and locative verbs by affixes; and in the general
system of compound word structure. The incorporation of the
particle with the verbal root, appears to embody the germ of
the more comprehensive American holophrasms. Such affinities
point to others more markedly Asiatic; for analogies recognised
between the languages of the Deccan and those of the Polynesian
group in relation to the determinative significance of
the formative particles on the verbal root, reappear in some of
the characteristic peculiarities of American languages. On this
subject, the Rev. Richard Garnett remarked, in a communication
to the Philological Society, that most of the native American
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
languages of which we have definite information, bear a general
analogy alike to the Polynesian family and to the languages of the
Deccan, in their methods of distinguishing the various modifications
of time; and he adds: “We may venture to affirm, in
general terms, that a South American verb is constructed
precisely as those in the Tamil and other languages of
Southern India; consisting, like them, of a verbal root, a
second element defining the time of the action, and a third
denoting the subject or person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far it becomes apparent that the evidence, derived alike
from language and from other sources, points to the isolation
of the American continent through unnumbered ages. The
legend of the lost Atlantis is true in this, if in nothing else,
that it relegates the knowledge of the world beyond the
Atlantic, by the maritime races of the Mediterranean, to a time
already of hoar antiquity in the age of Socrates, or even of
Solon. But at a greatly later date the Caribbean Sea was
scarcely more a mystery to the dwellers on the shores of the
Ægean, than was the Baltic or the North Sea. Herodotus,
indeed, expressly affirms his disbelief in “a river, called by
the barbarians, Eridanus, which flows into a northern sea, and
from which there is a report that amber is wont to come.”
Nevertheless, we learn from him of Greek traders exchanging
personal ornaments and woven stuffs for the furs and amber of
the North. They ascended the Dneiper as far as Gerrhos,
a trading-post, forty days’ journey inland; and the tokens of
their presence there have been recovered in modern times.
Not only hoards of Greek coins, minted in the fifth century
<span class='sc'>b.c.</span>, but older golden gryphons of Assyrian workmanship have
been recovered during the present century, near Bromberg in
Posen, and at Kiev on the Dneiper. As also, afar on the most
northern island of the Azores, hoards of Carthaginian coins
have revealed traces of the old Punic voyager there; if still
more ancient voyagers from Sidon, Tyre, or Seleucia, did find
their way in some forgotten century to lands that lay beyond
the waste of waters which seemed to engirdle their world:
similar evidence may yet be forthcoming among the traces of
ancient native civilisation in Central or Southern America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But also the carving of names and dates, and other graphic
memorials of the passing wayfarer, is no mere modern custom.
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
When the sites of Greenland settlements of the Northmen of
the tenth century were discovered in our own day, the runic
inscriptions left no room for doubt as to their former presence
there. By like evidence we learn of them in southern lands,
from their runes still legible on the marble lion of the Piræus,
since transported to its later site in the arsenal of Venice. At
Maeshowe in Orkney, in St. Molio’s Cave on the Clyde, at
Kirk Michael in the Isle of Man, and on many a rock and
stone by the Baltic, the sea-rovers from the north have left
enduring evidence of their wanderings. So was it with the
Roman. From the Moray Firth to the Libyan desert, and
from the Iberian shore to the Syrian valleys, sepulchral,
legionary, and mythological inscriptions, as well as coins,
medals, pottery, and works of art, mark the footprints of the
masters of the world. In Italy itself Perusinian, Eugubine,
Etruscan, and Greek inscriptions tell the story of a succession
of races in that beautiful peninsula. It was the same, through
all the centuries of Hellenic intellectual rule, back to the
unrivalled inscription at Abbu Simbel. This was cut, says
Dr. Isaac Taylor,<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> “when what we call Greek history can
hardly be said to have commenced: two hundred years before
Herodotus, the Father of History, had composed his work; a
century before Athens began to rise to power. More ancient
even than the epoch assigned to Solon, Thales, and the seven
wise men of Greece: it must be placed in the half-legendary
period at which the laws of Dracon are said to have been
enacted”;—the period, in fact, from which the legend of
Atlantis was professedly derived. Yet there the graven
characters perpetuate their authentic bit of history, legible
to this day, of the son of Theokles, sailing with his company
up the Nile, when King Psamatichos came to Elephantina.
So it is with Egyptians, Assyrians, Phœnicians, and with the
strange forgotten Hittites, whose vast empire has vanished out
of the world’s memory. The lion of the Piræus, with its
graven runes, is a thing of yesterday, compared with the
inscribed lion from Marash, with its Hittite hieroglyphs, now
in the museum at Constantinople; for the Hittite capital,
Ketesh, was captured by the Egyptian Sethos, <span class='sc'>b.c.</span> 1340.
All but the name of this once powerful people seemed to have
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
perished. Yet the inscribed stones, by which they were to be
restored to their place in history, remained, awaiting the interpretation
of an enlightened age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If then, traces of the lost Atlantis are ever to be recovered
in the New World, it must be by some indubitable memorial
of a like kind. Old as the legend may be, it is seen that
literal graphic memorials—Assyrian, Phœnician, Khita,
Egyptian, and Greek,—still remain to tell of times even beyond
the epoch assigned to Solon. The antiquaries of New England
have sought in vain for runic memorials of the Northmen of the
tenth century; and the diligence of less trustworthy explorers
for traces of ancient records has been stimulated to excess,
throughout the North American continent, with results little
more creditable to their honesty than their judgment. What
some chance disclosure may yet reveal, who can presume to
guess? But thus far it appears to be improbable that within
the area north of the Gulf of Mexico, evidences of the presence
of Phœnician, Greek, or other ancient historic race will now be
found. Certain it is that, whatever transient visits may have
been paid to North America by representatives of Old World
progress, no long-matured civilisation, whether of native or
foreign origin, has existed there. Through all the centuries of
which definite history has anything to tell, it has remained a
world apart, secure in its isolation, with languages, arts, and
customs essentially native in character. The nations of the
Maya stock appear to have made the greatest progress in
civilisation of all the communities of Central America. They
dwelt in cities adorned with costly structures dedicated to the
purposes of religion and the state; and had political government,
and forms of social organisation, to all appearance, the
slow growth of many generations. They had, also, a well-matured
system of chronology; and have left behind them
graven and written records, analogous to those of ancient Egypt,
which still await decipherment. Whether this culture was
purely of native growth, or had its origin from the germs of an
Old World civilisation, can only be determined when its secrets
have been fully mastered. The region is even now very
partially explored. The students of American ethnology and
archæology are only awakening to some adequate sense of its
importance. But there appears to have been the centre of a
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
native American civilisation whence light was slowly radiating
on either hand, before the vandals of the Spanish Conquest
quenched it in blood. The civilisation of Mexico was but a
borrowed reflex of that of Central America; and its picture-writing
is a very inferior imitation of the ideography of the
Maya hieroglyphics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tendency manifests itself anew to trace the metallurgy,
the letters, the astronomical science, and whatever else marks
the quickening into intellectual life of this American leading
race, to an Asiatic or other Old World origin. The point,
however, is by no means established; nor can any reason be
shown why the human intellect might not be started on the
same course in Central America, as in Mesopotamia or the
valley of the Nile. If we assume the primary settlement of
Central America by expeditions systematically carried on under
the auspices of some ancient maritime power of the Mediterranean,
or of an early seat of Iberian or Libyan civilisation,
then they would, undoubtedly, transplant the arts of their old
home to the New World. But, on the more probable supposition
of wanderers, either by the Atlantic or the Pacific,
being landed on its shores, and becoming the undesigned
settlers of the continent, it is otherwise; and the probabilities
are still further diminished if we conceive of ocean wanderers
from island to island of the Pacific, at length reaching the
shores of the remote continent after the traditions of their
Asiatic fatherland had faded from the memory of later generations.
The condition of metallurgy as practised by the
Mexicans and Peruvians exhibited none of the matured phases
of an inheritance from remote generations, but partook rather
of the tentative characteristics of immature native art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are prone to overestimate the facilities by which the
arts of civilisation may be transplanted to remote regions. It
is not greatly more difficult to conceive of the rediscovery of
some of the essential elements of human progress than to
believe in the transference of them from the eastern to the
western hemisphere by wanderers from either Europe or Asia.
Take the average type of emigrants, such as are annually landed
by thousands at New York. They come from the most civilised
countries of Europe. Yet, how few among them all could
be relied upon for any such intelligent comprehension of metallurgy,
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
if left entirely to their own resources, as to be found
able to turn the mineral wealth of their new home to practical
account; or for astronomical science, such as would enable
them to construct a calendar, and start afresh a systematic
chronology. As to letters, the picture-writing of the Aztecs
was the same in principle as the rude art of the northern
Indians; and I cannot conceive of any reason for rejecting
the assumption of its native origin as an intellectual triumph
achieved by the labours of many generations. Every step is
still traceable, from the rude picturings on the Indian’s grave-post
or rock inscription, to the systematic ideographs of Palenque
or Copan. Hieroglyphics, as the natural outgrowth of
pictorial representation, must always have a general family
likeness; but all attempts to connect the civilisation of
Central and Southern America with that of Egypt fail, so soon
as a comparison is instituted between the Egyptian calendar
and any of the native American systems of recording dates and
computing time. The vague year of 365 days, and the corrected
solar year, with the great Sothic Cycle of 1460 years,
so intimately interwoven with the religious system and historical
chronology of the Egyptians, abundantly prove the correction
of the Egyptian calendar by accumulated experience, at a
date long anterior to the resort of the Greek astronomer, Thales,
to Egypt. At the close of the fifteenth century, the Aztecs had
learned to correct their calendar to solar time; but their cycle
was one of only fifty-two years. The Peruvians also had their
recurrent religious festivals, connected with the adjustment of
their sacred calendar to solar time; but the geographical position
of Peru, with Quito, its holy city, lying immediately under
the equator, greatly simplified the process by which they regulated
their religious festivals by the solstices and equinoxes.
The facilities which their equatorial position afforded for determining
the few indispensable periods in their calendar were,
indeed, a doubtful advantage, for they removed all stimulus to
progress. The Mexican calendar is the most remarkable
evidence of the civilisation attained by that people. Humboldt
unhesitatingly connected it with the ancient science of south-eastern
Asia. But instead of its exhibiting any such inevitable
accumulation of error as that which gave so peculiar a character
to the historical chronology of the Egyptians, its computation
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
differed less from true solar time than the unreformed
Julian calendar which the Spaniards had inherited from pagan
Rome. But though this suffices to show that the civilisation
of Mexico was of no great antiquity, it only accords with other
evidence of its borrowed character. The Mexicans stood in
the same relation to Central America as the Northern Barbarians
of the third and fourth century did to Italy; and the
intruding Spaniard nipped their germ of borrowed civilisation
in the bud. So long as the search for evidences either of a
native or intruded civilisation is limited to the northern continent
of America, it is equivalent to an attempt to recover the
traces of Greek and Roman civilisation in transalpine Europe.
The Mexican calendar stone is no more than the counterpart
of some stray Greek or Roman tablet beyond the Alps; or
rather, perhaps, of some Mæsogothic product of borrowed
art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We must await, then, the intelligent exploration of Central
America, before any certain conclusion can be arrived at relative
to the story of the New World’s unknown past. On the
sculptured tablets of Palenque, Quiriqua, Chichenitza, and
Uxmal, and on the colossal statues at Copan and other
ancient sites, are numerous inscriptions awaiting the decipherment
of the future Young or Champolion of American palæography.
The whole region was once in occupation by a
lettered race, having the same written characters and a
common civilisation. If they owed to some apostle from the
Mediterranean the grand invention of letters, which, as Bacon
says, “as ships, pass through the vast seas of time, and make
ages so distant to participate of the wisdom, illuminations and
inventions, the one of the other:” then, we may confidently
anticipate the recovery of some graphic memorial of the
messenger, confirming the oft-recurring traditions of bearded
white men who came from beyond the sea, introduced the
arts of civilisation, and were reverenced as divine benefactors.
It cannot be that Egyptian, Assyrian, Hittite, Phœnician, and
other most ancient races, are still perpetuated by so many
traces of their wanderings in the Old World; that the Northmen’s
graphic runes have placed beyond all question their
pre-Columbian explorations; and yet that not a single trace
of Mediterranean wanderers to the lost Atlantis survives. In
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
Humboldt’s <span class='it'>Researches</span>, a fragment of a reputed Phœnician
inscription is engraved. It was copied by Ranson Bueno, a
Franciscan monk, from a block of granite which he discovered
in a cavern in the mountain chain, between the Orinoco and
the Amazon. Humboldt recognised in it some resemblance to
the Phœnician alphabet. We must remember, however, what
rudely traced Phœnician characters are; and as to their
transcriber, it may be presumed that he had no knowledge of
Phœnician. Humboldt says of him: “The good monk seemed
to be but little interested about this pretended inscription,”
though, he adds, he had copied it very carefully.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The lost Atlantis, then, lies still in the future. The earlier
studies of the monuments and prehistoric remains of the
American continent seemed to point conclusively to a native
source for its civilisation. From quipu and wampum, pictured
grave-post and buffalo robe, to the most finished hieroglyphs of
Copan or Palenque, continuous steps appear to be traceable
whereby American man developed for himself the same
wondrous invention of letters which ancient legend ascribed to
Thoth or Mercury; or, in less mythic form, to the Phœnician
Cadmus. Nor has the generally accepted assumption of a
foreign origin for American metallurgy been placed as yet on
any substantial basis. Gold, as I believe, was everywhere the
first metal wrought. The bright nugget tempted the savage,
with whom personal ornaments precede dress. It was readily
fashioned into any desired shape. The same is true, though
in a less degree, of copper; and wherever, as on the American
continent, native copper abounds, the next step in metallurgy
is to be anticipated. With the discovery of the economic use
of the metals, an all-important step had been achieved, leading
to the fashioning of useful tools, to architecture, sculpture,
pictorial ornamentation, and so to ideography. The facilities
for all this were, at least, as abundant in Central and Southern
America as in Egypt. The progress was, doubtless, slow; but
when the Neolithic age began to yield to that of the metallurgist,
the all-important step had been taken. The history of
this first step is embodied in myths of the New World, no less
than of the Old. Tubal-cain, Dædalus, Hephæstus, Vulcan,
Vœlund, Galant, and Wayland the Saxon smith-god, are all
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
legendary variations of the first mastery of the use of the
metals; and so, too, the New World has Quetzalcoatl, its divine
instructor in the same priceless art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It forms one of the indisputable facts of ancient history
that, long before Greece became the world’s intellectual leader,
the eastern Mediterranean was settled by maritime races
whose adventurous enterprise led them to navigate the Atlantic.
There was no greater impediment to such adventurous
mariners crossing that ocean in earliest centuries before Christ,
than at any subsequent date prior to the revival of navigation
in the fifteenth century. It would not, therefore, in any
degree, surprise me to learn of the discovery of a genuine
Phœnician, or other inscription; or, of some hoard of Assyrian
gryphons, or shekels of the merchant princes of Tyre “that
had knowledge of the sea,” being recovered among the still
unexplored treasures of the buried empire of Montezuma, or
the long-deserted ruins of Central America. Such a discovery
would scarcely be more surprising than that of the Punic
hoards found at Corvo, the most westerly island of the Azores.
Yet it would furnish a substantial basis for the legend of
Atlantis, akin to that which the runic monuments of Kingiktorsoak
and Igalikko supplied in confirmation of the fabled
charms of a Hesperian region lying within the Arctic circle;
and of the first actual glimpses of the American mainland by
Norse voyagers of the tenth century, as told in more than one
of their old Sagas. But until such evidence is forthcoming,
the legendary Atlantis must remain a myth, and pre-Columbian
America be still credited with a self-achieved progress.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> idea that the western hemisphere was known to the Old
World, prior to the ever-memorable voyage of Columbus four
centuries ago, has reproduced itself in varying phases, not only
in the venerable Greek legend of the lost Atlantis; and the
still vaguer myth of the Garden of the Hesperides on the far
ocean horizon, the region of the setting sun; but in mediæval
fancies and mythical epics. The Breton, in <span class='it'>The Earthly

<p class='noindent'>A legend of mediæval hagiology tells of the Island of St.
Brandon, the retreat of an Irish hermit of the sixth century.
Another tale comes down to us from the time of the Caliph
Walid, and the invincible Musa, of the “Seven Islands”
whither the Christians of Gothic Spain fled under the
guidance of their seven bishops, when, in the eighth century,
the peninsula passed under the yoke of the victorious Saracens.
The Eyrbyggja Saga has a romantic story of Biorn Ashbrandsson,
who narrowly escapes in a tempest raised by his enemy,
with the aid of one skilled in the black art. After undergoing
many surprising adventures, he is finally discovered by
voyagers, “in the latter days of Olaf the Saint,” in a strange
land beyond the ocean, the chief of a warlike race speaking a
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
language that seemed to be Irish. Biorn warned the voyagers
to depart, for the people had evil designs against them. But
before they sailed, he took a gold ring from his hand, and gave
it to Gudleif, their leader, along with a goodly sword; and
commissioned him to give the sword to Kiartan, the son of
Thurid, wife of an Iceland thane at Froda, of whom he had
been enamoured; and the gold ring to his mother. This done,
he warned them that no man venture to renew the search for
what later commentators refer to as White Man’s Land. In
equally vague form the fancy of lands beyond the ocean perpetuated
itself in an imaginary island of Brazil that flitted
about the charts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries with
ever-varying site and proportions, till it vanished in the light
of modern exploration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A more definite character has been given to the tale of
Madoc, a Welsh prince of the twelfth century. Southey wove
into an elaborate epic this legend of the son of Owen Gwyneth,
king of North Wales, who, <span class='it'>circa</span> <span class='sc'>a.d.</span> 1170, sailed into the
unknown west in search of a resting-place beyond reach of his
brother Yorwerth, then ridding himself of all rivals to the
throne. He found a home in the New World, returned to
Wales for additional colonists to join the pioneer band; and
setting sail with them, vanished beyond the western horizon,
and was heard of no more. The poet, while adapting it to the
purpose of his art, was not without faith in the genuineness of
the legend which he amplified into his epic; and notes in the
preface appended to it: “Strong evidence has been adduced
that he (Prince Madoc) reached America; and that his
posterity exist there to this day on the southern branch of the
Missouri, retaining their complexion, their language, and in
some degree, their arts.” But later explorations have failed to
discover any “Welsh Indians” on the Missouri or its tributaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A small grain of fact will suffice at times for the crystallisation
of vague and visionary fancies into a well-credited
tradition. Before the printing-press came into play, with its
perpetuation of definite records, and prosaic sifting of evidence,
this was no uncommon occurrence; but even in recent times
fancy may be seen transmuted into accepted fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When exploring the great earthworks of the Ohio valley,
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
in 1874, I found myself on one occasion in a large Welsh
settlement, a few miles from Newark, where a generation of
native-born Americans still perpetuate the language of their
Cymric forefathers, and conduct their religious services in
the Welsh tongue. My attention was first called to this by
the farmer, who had invited me to an early dinner after a
morning’s digging in a mound on “The Evan’s Farm,” preceding
our repast with a long Welsh grace. From him I learned
that the district had been settled in 1802 by a Welsh
colony; and that in two churches in neighbouring valleys—one
Calvinistic Congregational and another Methodist,—the
entire services are still conducted in their mother tongue.
Such a perpetuation of the language and traditions of the
race, in a quiet rural district, only required time and the
confusion of dates and genealogies by younger generations,
to have engrafted the story of Prince Madoc on the substantial
basis of a genuine Welsh settlement. Southey’s epic
was published in 1805, within three years after this Welsh
immigration to the Ohio valley. The subject of the poem
naturally gave it a special attraction for American readers;
and it was speedily reprinted in the United States, doubtless
with the same indifference to the author’s claim of copyright as
long continued to characterise the ideas of literary ethics beyond
the Atlantic. But the idea of a Welsh Columbus of the
twelfth century was by no means received with universal favour
there. Southey quoted at a long-subsequent date a critical
pamphleteer who denounced the author of <span class='it'>Madoc</span> as having
“meditated a most serious injury against the reputation of
the New World by attributing its discovery and colonisation
to a vagabond Welsh prince; this being a most insidious
attempt against the honour of America, and the reputation of
Columbus!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is inevitable that America should look back to the Old
World when in search of some elements of civilisation, and
for the diversities of race and language traceable throughout
the western hemisphere. The early students of the sculptured
monuments and hieroglyphic records of Mexico, Central
America, and Peru, naturally turned to Egypt as their
probable source; though mature reflection has dissipated much
of the reasoning based on superficial analogies. The gradations
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
from the most primitive picture-writing of the Indian
savage to ideography and abbreviated symbolism, are so
clearly traceable in the various stages of progress, from the
rude forest tribes to the native centres of civilisation in
Central and Southern America, that no necessity remains for
assuming any foreign source for their origin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the world beyond the Atlantic had remained through
unnumbered centuries apart from Europe and the old East,
until that memorable year 1492, is indisputable; and there
was at one time a disposition to resent any rivalry with the
grand triumph of Columbus; as though patriotic spirit and
national pride demanded an unquestioning faith in that as the
sole link that bound America to the Old World. But the
same spirit stimulated other nations to claim precedence of
Spain and the great Genoese; and for this the Scandinavian
colonists of Iceland had every probability in their favour.
They had navigated the Arctic Ocean with no other compass
than the stars; and the publication in 1845, by the Danish
antiquaries, of the <span class='it'>Grenlands Historiske Mindesmærker</span> recalled
minute details of their settlements in the inhospitable
region of the western hemisphere to which they gave the
strange misnomer of Greenland. But the year 1837 may
be regarded as marking an epoch in the history of ante-Columbian
research. The issue in that earlier year of the
<span class='it'>Antiquitates Americanæ, sive scriptores septentrionales rerum
ante-Columbiarum in America</span>, by the Royal Society of Northern
Antiquaries, under the editorship of Professor Charles
Christian Rafn, produced a revolution, alike in the form and
the reception of illustrations of ante-Columbian American
history. The publication of that work gave a fresh interest
to the vaguest intimations of a dubious past; while it superseded
them by tangible disclosures, which, though modern in
comparison with such mythic antiquities as the Atlantis of
Plato’s <span class='it'>Dialogues</span>, nevertheless added some five centuries to
the history of the New World. From its appearance, accordingly,
may be dated the systematic aim of American antiquaries
and historians to find evidence of intercourse with the
ancient world prior to the fifteenth century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This influence became manifest in all ways; and abundant
traces of the novel idea are to be found in the popular literature
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
of the time. It seemed as though the adventurous spirit
of the early Greenland explorers had revived, as in the days
of the first Vinlanders, as told in the Saga of Eric the Red:
“About this time there began to be much talk at Brattahlid,
to the effect that Vinland the Good should be explored; for it
was said that country must be possessed of many good
qualities. And so it came to pass that Karlsefne and Snorri
fitted out their ship for the purpose of going in search of that
country.” Only the modern Vinlanders who follow in their
wake have had for their problem to—</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>Sail up the current of departed time</p>
<p class='line0'>And seek along its banks that vanished clime</p>

<p class='pindent'>The indomitable race that emerged from the Scandinavian
peninsula, and the islands and shores of the Baltic, and overran
and conquered the deserted Roman world, supplied the
maritime energy of Europe from the fifth to the tenth
century; and colonised northern Italy with the element to
which we must assign the rise of its great maritime republics,
including the one that was to furnish the discoverer of
America in the fifteenth century. Genoese and Spaniards
could not have made for themselves a home either in Greenland
or Iceland. Had the Northmen of the tenth century
been less hardy, they would probably have prosecuted their
discoveries, and found more genial settlements, such as have
since then proved the centres of colonisation for the Anglo-American
race. But of their actual discovery of some portion
of the mainland of North America, prior to the eleventh
century, there can be no reasonable doubt. The wonder
rather is that after establishing permanent settlements both in
Iceland and Greenland, their southern explorations were prosecuted
with such partial and transient results. The indomitable
Vikings were conquering fresh territories on the coasts
and islands of the North Sea, and giving a new name to the
fairest region of northern Gaul wrested by the Northmen from
its Frank conquerors. The same hardy supplanters were
following up such acquisitions by expeditions to the Mediterranean
that resulted in the establishment of their supremacy
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
over ancient historic races there, and training leaders for later
crusading adventure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voyage from Greenland, or even from Iceland, to the
New England shores was not more difficult than from the
native fiords of the Northmen to the Atlantic seaboard, or to
the coasts and islands of the Mediterranean. Everywhere
they left their record in graven runes. At Maeshowe in the
Orkneys, on Holy Island in the Firth of Clyde, and at Kirk
Michael, Kirk Andreas, and Kirk Braddon, on the Isle of
Man; or as the relic of a more ancient past, on the marble
lion of the Piræus, now at the arsenal of Venice: their runic
records are to be seen graven in the same characters as those
which have been recovered during the present century from
their early settlements beyond the Atlantic. Numerous
similar inscriptions from the homes of the Northmen are furnished
in Professor George Stephens’ <span class='it'>Old Northern Runic
Monuments</span>, which perpetuate memorials of the love of
adventure of those daring rovers, and the pride they took in
their expeditions to remote and strange lands. Intensified at
a later stage by religious fervour, the same spirit emboldened
them as leaders in the Crusades; and some of their runic
inscriptions tell of adventurous pilgrimages to the Holy Land.
An Icelandic rover is designated on his rune-stone <span class='it'>Rafn
Hlmrckfari</span> as a successful voyager to Ireland. Norwegian
and Danish bautastein frequently preserve the epithet of
<span class='it'>Englandsfari</span> for the leaders of expeditions to the British
Isles, or more vaguely refer to their adventures in “the
western parts.” King Sigurd of Norway proudly blazoned the
title of <span class='it'>Jórsolafari</span> as one who had achieved the pilgrimage to
Jerusalem; and the literate memorials of the Northmen of
Orkney, recovered in 1861, on the opening of the famous
Maeshowe Tumulus, include those of a band of Crusaders, or
Jerusalem-farers, who, in 1153, followed Earl Ragnvald to the
Holy Land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The inscribed rune-stones brought from the sites of the
ancient Norse colonies in Greenland, and now deposited in
the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities, at Copenhagen,
are simple personal or sepulchral inscriptions. But they are
graven in the northern runes, and as such constitute
monuments of great historical value: furnishing indisputable
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
evidence of the presence of European colonists beyond the
Atlantic centuries before that memorable 12th of October
1492, on which the eyes of the wistful gazers from the deck
of the “Santa Maria” were gladdened with their first glimpse
of what they believed to be the India of the far east: the
Cipango in search of which they had entered on their adventurous
voyage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colonies of Greenland, after being occupied, according
to Norwegian and Danish tradition, from the tenth to the
fifteenth century, were entirely forgotten. The colonists are
believed to have been exterminated by the native Eskimo.
The very locality chosen for their settlements was so completely
lost sight of that, when an interest in their history
revived, and expeditions were sent out to revisit the scene of
early Norse colonisation beyond the Atlantic, much time was
lost in a fruitless search on the coast lying directly west from
Iceland. Towards the middle of the seventeenth century, an
oar drifted to the Iceland coast, a relic, as was believed, of
the long-lost colony of Greenland, bearing this inscription in
runic characters: <span class='sc'>oft var ek dasa dur ek dro thick</span>—<span class='it'>Oft
was I weary when I drew thee</span>; but it was not till the close
of the century that the traditions of the old Greenlanders
began to excite attention. Many a Norse legend pictured the
enviable delights of the fabled Hesperian region discovered
within the Arctic circle, yet meriting by the luxuriance of its
fertile valleys its name of Greenland; and the fancies and
legendary traditions that gradually displaced the history of
the old colony, had been interwoven by the poet Montgomery
with the tale of self-sacrificing labours of Moravian Missionaries,
in the cantos of his <span class='it'>Greenland</span> epic, long before the
<span class='it'>Antiquitates Americanæ</span> issued from the Copenhagen press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The narrations of ancient voyagers, and their explorations
in the New World, as brought to light in 1835 by the
Copenhagen volume on pre-Columbian America, were too
truthful in their aspect to be slighted; and too fascinating in
their revelations of a long-forgotten intercourse between the
Old World and the New, to be willingly subjected to incredulous
analysis. From the genuine literary memorials of older
centuries, sufficient evidence could be gleaned to place beyond
question, not only the discovery and colonisation of Greenland
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
by Eric the Red,—apparently in the year 985,—but also the
exploration of southern lands, some of which must have
formed part of the American continent. The manuscripts
whence those narratives are derived are of various dates, and
differ widely in value; but of the genuineness and historical
significance of the oldest of them, no doubt can be entertained.
The accounts which some of them furnish are so simple, and
devoid of anything extravagant or improbable, that the
internal evidence of truthfulness is worthy of great consideration.
The exuberant fancy of the Northmen, which revels in
their mythology and songs, would have constructed a very
different tale had it been employed in the invention of a
southern continent, or earthly Paradise fashioned from the
dreams of Icelandic and Greenland rovers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The narrative attaches itself to genuine Icelandic history;
and furnishes a coherent, and seemingly unexaggerated account
of a voyage characterised by nothing that is supernatural;
and little that is even romantic. Eric Thorvaldsson, more
commonly referred to as Erikr Rauthi, or Eric the Red, a
banished Icelandic jarl, made his way to the Greenland coast
and effected a settlement at Igalikko, or Brattalid, as it was
at first called, from whence one of the runic inscriptions now
in the Copenhagen museum was taken. Before the close of
the century, if not in the very year <span class='sc'>a.d.</span> 1000, in which St.
Olaf was introducing Christianity into Norway, Leif, or Leiv
Ericson, a son of the first coloniser of Greenland, appears to
have accidentally discovered the American mainland. The
story, current in Norwegian and Icelandic tradition, and
repeated with additions and variations in successive Sagas,
most frequently ascribes to Leif an actual exploratory voyage
in quest of southern lands already reported to have been seen
by Bjarni Herjulfson. But the Sagas from whence the
revived story of Vinland is derived are of different dates, and
very varying degrees of credibility. Of those, the narrative in
which the name of Bjarni Herjulfson first appears occurs in a
manuscript of the latter part of the fourteenth century; and
exhibits both amplifications and inconsistencies abundantly
justifying its rejection as an authority for depriving Leif Ericson
of the honour of the discovery of the North American
continent. He was on his way from Norway to Greenland
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
when he was driven out of his course, and so reached the
mainland of the New World in that early century; even as,
five centuries later, the Portuguese admiral, Pedro Alvarez
Cabral, when on his way to the Cape, was driven westward to
the coast of Brazil, and so to the discovery of the southern
continent. For later generations the tale of the old Vinland
explorers—whose goodly land of the vine, and of fertile meads
of grain, had faded away as a dream,—naturally gathered around
it exaggerations and legendary fable; but such terms are
wholly inapplicable to the original Saga. The story of Thorfinn’s
expedition to effect a settlement on the new-found land,
within three or four years after Leif Ericson’s reported discovery,
is a simple, consistent narrative, rendered attractive by
natural and highly suggestive incidents, but entirely free from
mythical or legendary features. This is obviously the basis
of the varying and inconsistent tales of later Sagas. The year
1003 is the date assigned to the expedition in which Thorfinn
set out, with three ships and a considerable company of
adventurers, and effected a temporary settlement of Vinland.
Voyaging southward, he first landed on a barren coast where
a great plain covered with flat stones stretched from the sea
to a lofty range of ice-clad mountains. To this he gave the
name of Helluland, from <span class='it'>hella</span>, a flat stone. The earlier
editor, having the requirements of his main theory in view,
found in its characteristics evidence sufficient to identify it
with Newfoundland; but Professor Gustav Storm assigns
reasons for preferring Labrador as more probable.<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> The next
point touched presented a low shore of white sand, and
beyond it a level country covered with forest, to which the
name of Markland, or woodland, was given. This, which, so
far as the description can guide us, might be anywhere on the
American coast, was assumed by the editor of the <span class='it'>Antiquitates
Americanæ</span> to be Nova Scotia; but, according to
Professor Storm, can have been no other country than Newfoundland.
The voyagers, after two more days at sea, again
saw land; and of this the characteristic that the dew upon
the grass tasted sweet, was accepted as sufficient evidence that
Nantucket, where honey-dew abounds, is the place referred to.
Their further course shoreward, and up a river into the lake
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
from which it flowed, has been assumed to have been up the
Pacasset River to Mount Hope Bay. There the voyagers
passed the winter. After erecting temporary booths, their
leader divided them into two parties, which alternately proceeded
on exploring excursions. One of his followers, a
southerner,—<span class='it'>sudrmadr</span>, or German, as he is assumed to have
been,—having wandered, he reported on his return the
discovery of wine-trees and grapes; and hence the name of
Vineland, given to the locality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This land of the vine, discovered by ancient voyagers on
the shores of the New World, naturally awakened the liveliest
interest in the minds of American antiquaries and historical
students; nor is that interest even now wholly a thing of the
past. Is this “Vinland the Good” a reality? Can it be
located on any definite site? Montgomery’s <span class='it'>Greenland</span>
epic was published in 1819; and the poet, with no American
or Canadian pride of locality to beguile him in his interpretation
of the evidence, observes in one of the notes to his poem:
“Leif and his party wintered there, and observed that on the
shortest day the sun rose about eight o’clock, which may correspond
with the forty-ninth degree of latitude, and denotes the
situation of Newfoundland, or the River St. Lawrence.” The
reference here is to the sole data on which all subsequent
attempts to determine the geographical location of Vinland
have been based; and after upwards of sixty years of speculation
and conjecture, Professor Gustav Storm in his <span class='it'>Studier over
Vinlandsreiserne</span>, arrives at a nearly similar conclusion. Vinland
cannot have lain farther north than 49°. How far
southward of this its site may be sought for is matter of
conjecture; but all probabilities are opposed to its discovery so
far south as Rhode Island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Rafn, however, arrived at very different results;
and found abundant confirmation in the sympathetic responses
of the Rhode Island antiquaries. The famous Dighton Rock
was produced, with its assumed runic inscription. The
Newport Round Tower was a still more satisfactory indication
of permanent settlement by its supposed Norse builders; and
“The Skeleton in Armour,” on which Longfellow founded his
ballad romance, was accepted without hesitation as a glimpse
of one of the actual colonists of Vinland in the eleventh
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
century. Professor Rafn accordingly summed up the inquiry,
and set forth the conclusions arrived at, in this definite
fashion. “It is the total result of the nautical, geographical,
and astronomical evidence in the original documents, which
places the situations of the countries discovered beyond all
doubt. The number of days’ sail between the several newly-found
lands, the striking description of the coasts, especially
the sand-banks of Nova Scotia; and the long beaches and
downs of a peculiar appearance on Cape Cod (the <span class='it'>Kialarnes</span>
and <span class='it'>Furdustrandir</span> of the Northmen,) are not to be mistaken.
In addition hereto we have the astronomical remark that the
shortest day in Vinland was nine hours long, which fixes the
latitude of 41° 24′ 10″, or just that of the promontories which
limit the entrance to Mount Hope Bay, where Leif’s booths
were built, and in the district around which the old Northmen
had their head establishment, which was named by them <span class='it'>Hóp</span>,
or the Creek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dighton Rock runes erelong fell into woeful discredit;
and as for the Newport Round Tower, it has been identified as
“The Old Stone Mill” built there by Governor Benedict
Arnold, who removed from Providence to Newport in 1653.
Though therefore no longer to be accredited to the Northmen,
it is of very respectable architectural antiquity, according to
New World reckoning. Nevertheless, in spite of such failure
of all confirmatory evidence, the general summary of results
was presented by Professor Rafn in such absolute terms, and
the geographical details of the assumed localities were so
confidently accredited by the members of the Rhode Island
Historical Society, that his conclusions were accepted as a
whole without cavil. In reality, however, when we revert to
the evidence from which such definite results were derived, it
proves vague, if not illusory. The voyagers crossed over from
Greenland to Helluland, which we may assume without hesitation
to have been the inhospitable coast of Labrador. They
then pursued a south-western course, in a voyage in all of four
days, subdivided into two nearly equal parts, until they
landed on a coast where wild grapes grew, and which
accordingly they named the Land of the Vine. To Icelandic
or Greenland voyagers, the vine, with its clusters of grapes,
however unpalatable, could not fail to prove an object of
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
special note. But there is no need to prolong the four days’
run, and land the explorers beyond Cape Cod, in order to find
the wild grape. It grows in sheltered localities in Nova
Scotia; and so in no degree conflicts with the later deductions
based on the same astronomical evidence of the length of the
shortest day, which have induced subsequent investigators to
adopt conclusions much more nearly approximating to those
suggested by the poet Montgomery fully sixteen years before
the issue of Professor Rafn’s learned quarto from the Copenhagen
press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The topographical details which have to be relied upon in
any attempt to identify the precise locality are little less vague
than those of the astronomical data from which the editor of
the <span class='it'>Antiquitates Americanæ</span> assumed to compute his assigned
latitude. The voyagers, after their first wintering, pursued
their course southward; and again approaching the shore, made
their way up a river, to a lake from whence it flowed. The
land was wooded, with wild “wheat” in the low meadows,
and on the high banks grape-bearing vines. The aspect of this
strange land was tempting to voyagers from the north, so they
erected booths, and wintered there. From the mouth of the
St. Lawrence southward to Rhode Island, the coast is indented
with many an estuary, up any of which the old voyagers may
have found their way into lake or expanded basin, with overhanging
forest trees, meadow flats, and other features
sufficiently corresponding to all that we learn from the old
Saga of the temporary settlement of Thorfinn and his fellow-voyagers.
Fresh claimants accordingly enter the lists to
contend for the honours that pertain to the landing-place of
those first Pilgrim Fathers. New Englanders above all not
unnaturally cherish the pleasant fancy that they had for their
precursors the hardy Vikings, who, resenting the oppression of
King Harold the fair-haired, sailed into the unknown west to
find a free home for themselves. The fancy had a double
claim on the gifted musician Ole Bull. Himself a wanderer
from the Scandinavian fatherland, he started the proposition
which was to give an air of indisputable reality to the old
legend; and which culminated in the erection, on Boston
Common, in 1888, of a fine statue of Leif Ericson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“South of Greenland is Helluland; next is Markland;
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
from thence is not far to Vinland the Good.” So reads the
old Saga; and with the rearing of the statue of its finder, it
seemed incumbent on some loyal son of the Commonwealth to
demonstrate the site of the good land within the area of
Massachusetts. In the following year, accordingly, Professor
Eben Norton Horsford, of Cambridge, undertook the search,
and was able to identify to his entire satisfaction the site of
Leif’s, or Karlsefne’s booths, in his own neighbourhood on the
Charles river. First appeared in 1889 <span class='it'>The Problem of the
Northmen</span>; and in the following year, in choicest typography,
and amplitude of attractive illustrations, <span class='it'>The Discovery of
the Ancient City of Norumbega, at Watertown on the River
Charles</span>. There the ephemeral booths of the old winterers in
Vinland had left enduring traces after a lapse of more than
eight centuries. The discoverer, resolved to arrest “Time’s
decaying fingers,” which had thus far been laid with such
unwonted gentleness on the pioneer relics, has marked the
spot with a memorial tower, and an elaborately inscribed
tablet, one clause of which runs thus: “<span class='sc'>River, The Charles,

<p class='pindent'>The entire evidence has been readduced with minutest
critical accuracy in <span class='it'>The Finding of Wineland the Good: the
History of the Icelandic Discovery of America</span>, by the late gifted
Arthur Middleton Reeves. His verdict is thus briefly stated:
“There is no suggestion in Icelandic records of a permanent
occupation of the county; and after the exploration at the
beginning of the eleventh century, it is not known that Wineland
was ever again visited by Icelanders, although it would
appear that a voyage thither was attempted in the year 1121,
but with what result is not known.”<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a> In the Codex Frisianus
is an apt heading which might, better than a more lengthy
inscription, have given expression to the pleasant fancy that
the footprints of Leif Ericson’s followers had been recovered
on the banks of the Charles river, “<span class='sc'>Fundit Vinland Gotha</span>”—Vineland
the Good found! Maps old and new illustrate the
topography of the newly-assigned site; and among the rest,
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
one which specially aims at reproducing the most definite
feature of the old narrative is thus titled:—“River flowing
through a lake into the sea; Vinland of the Northmen; site
of Leif’s houses.” To his own satisfaction, at least, it is
manifest that the author has identified the site.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a great deal more than Leif’s booths is involved. It is
the discovery of the ancient city of Norumbega, of which also
the inscribed tablet makes due record; including the statement,
set forth more fully in the printed text, that the name is only
an Indian transmutation of “Norbega, the ancient form of
Norvega, Norway, to which Vinland was subject!” The name,
though probably unfamiliar to most modern readers, was once
as well known as that of Utopia, or El Dorado. One of Sir
John Hawkins’ fellow-voyagers claimed to have seen the city
of Norumbega still standing in 1568: a gorgeous Indian
town outvying the capital of Montezuma, and resplendent in
pearls and gold. Hakluyt proposed its recolonisation; Sir
Humphrey Gilbert went in search of it; and it figures both
as a city and a country on maps familiar to older generations
than the founders of New England. Above all, Milton has
given it a place in the Tenth Book of his <span class='it'>Paradise Lost</span>.
When the Divine Creator is represented as readapting this
world to a fallen race—</p>

<p class='noindent'>which seems to imply very Icelandic and Arctic associations
of the Miltonic muse. But the gentle New England poet,
Whittier, who had sung of his Christian knight in vain quest of
the marvellous city, thus writes in sober prose to its modern
discoverer: “I had supposed that the famed city of Norumbega
was on the Penobscot when I wrote my poem some
years ago; but I am glad to think of it as on the Charles,
in our own Massachusetts.” This work of rearing anew
on the banks of the river Charles the metropolis of Vinland
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
the Good may be best entrusted to the poets of New
England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All praise is due to the enthusiastic editors of the <span class='it'>Antiquitates
Americanæ</span> for their reproduction of the original records
on which the history and the legends of Vinland rest. They
found only too willing recipients of the theories and assumptions
with which they supplemented the genuine narrative;
nor has the uncritical spirit of credulous deduction wholly
ceased. In the untimely death of Professor Munch, the historian
of Norway, the University of Christiana lost a ripe and
acutely critical scholar in the very flower of his years. But in
Dr. Gustav Storm a successor has been found not unworthy to
fill his place, and represent the younger generation of Northern
antiquaries, who have now taken in hand, in a more critical
spirit, yet with no less enthusiasm, the work so well begun by
Rafn, Finn Magnusen, and Sveinbiorn Egilsson. In the same
year in which Leif Ericson’s statue was set up in Boston, and
all the old enthusiasm for the identification of the lost Vinland
was revived, there appeared in the <span class='it'>Mémoires de la Société Royale
des Antiquaires du Nord</span> a series of <span class='it'>Studies on the Vineland
Voyages</span>, from the pen of Professor Storm, embodying a critical
analysis of the evidence relating to the Vinland voyages, which
is treated still more fully in his <span class='it'>Studier over Vinlandsreiserne,
Vinlands Geografi og Ethnographi</span>. The whole is now available,
along with valuable additions, including photographic facsimiles
illustrative of the original MSS., in Reeves’ <span class='it'>Finding of
Wineland the Good</span>.<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a> The evidence has to be gleaned from
two independent series of narratives: the one the Icelandic
Sagas and other embodiments of the Vinland tradition; the
other the more amplified, but less reliable narratives of Norwegian
chroniclers. The earliest Icelandic accounts are derived
directly or indirectly from Ari froði, more particularly referred
to on a later page, whose date as an author is given as about
1120; thereby marking the transmission of the narrative to a
younger generation before it was committed to writing. Ari
froði, <span class='it'>i.e.</span> the learned, derived the story from his paternal uncle
Thorkell Gellisson of Helgufell, who lived in the latter half of
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
the eleventh century; and so was a contemporary of Adam of
Bremen, who, when resident at the Danish Court, about the
year 1070, obtained the information relating to the Northern
regions which he embodied in his <span class='it'>Descriptio insularum aquilonis</span>.
Ari’s uncle, Thorkell, is said to have spoken, when
in Greenland, with a man who, in the year 985, had accompanied
Erik the Red on his expedition from Iceland; so that
the authority is good, if the narrative were sufficiently ample;
but unfortunately, though Ari’s notes of what he learned from
his uncle are still extant in the <span class='it'>Libellus Islandorum</span>, they are
exceedingly meagre. The Vinland explorations had no such
importance for the men of that age as they possess for us,
and are accordingly dealt with as a very secondary matter.
Professor Gustav Storm, in his <span class='it'>Studies on the Vineland Voyages</span>,
notes that Thorkell seems to have told his nephew most about
the colonisation of Greenland. In Professor Storm’s <span class='it'>Studies</span>,
and in the exhaustive <span class='it'>Finding of Wineland the Good</span>, by Arthur
Middleton Reeves, the entire bearings of the evidence, and the
relative value of the various ancient authorities, are discussed
with minute care; and lead alike to the inevitable conclusion
that any assignment of a site for the lost Vinland, either on
Rhode Island, or on any part of the New England coast, is untenable.
The deductions of Professor Rafn from the same evidence
were accepted as a final verdict, until the too eager confirmation
of his Rhode Island correspondents brought them into discredit.
Now when we undertake an unbiassed review of them, it is
manifest that too much weight has been attached to his estimate
of distances measured by the vague standard of a day’s
sail of a rude galley dependent on wind and tide. This Professor
Rafn assumed as equivalent to twenty-four geographical
miles. But very slight consideration suffices to show that, with
an indefinite starting-point, and only a vague indication of the
direction of sailing, with the unknown influences of wind and
tide, any such arbitrary deduction of a definite measurement
from the log of the old Northmen is not only valueless, but
misleading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A reconsideration of the evidence furnished by the references
to the fauna and flora of the different points touched at, shows
that others of Professor Rafn’s deductions are equally open to
correction. Helluland, a barren region, of large stone slabs,
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
with no other trace of life than the Arctic fox, presented the
same aspect as Labrador still offers to the eye of the voyager.
But there is no need to traverse the entire Canadian and New
England coasts before a region can be found answering to the
descriptions of a forest-clad country, of numerous deer, or even
of the vine, as noted by the old explorers from Greenland.
To the eye of the Greenlander, the Markland, or forest-clad
land, lay within sight no farther south than Newfoundland or
Cape Breton. To those who are accustomed to associate the
vine with the Rhine land, or the plains of Champagne, it
sounds equally extravagant to speak of the Maritime Provinces,
or of the New England States, as “Vinland the Good.” But
numerous allusions of voyagers and travellers of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries refer with commendation to the wild
grapes of North America. Jacques Cartier on making his way
up the St. Lawrence, in his second voyage, gave to the Isle of
Orleans the name of the Isle de Bacchus, because of the many
wild vines found there; though he notes that, “not being cultivated
nor pruned, the grapes are neither so large nor so sweet
as ours”—that is, those of France. Lescarbot, in like manner,
in 1606, records the grape vine as growing at Chuakouet, or
Saco, in Maine, and in the following year they are noted as
abundant along the banks of the river St. John in New
Brunswick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To voyagers from Iceland or Greenland many portions of
the coast of Nova Scotia would present the aspect of a region
clothed with forest, and, as such, “extremely beautiful.” Deer
are still abundant both there and in Newfoundland; and as
for the grapes gathered by Leif Ericson, or those brought back
to Thorvald by Hake and Hekia, the swift runners, at their
more northern place of landing, the wild vine is well known
at the present time in sheltered localities of Nova Scotia.
Having therefore carefully studied the earliest maps and charts,
of which reduced copies are furnished in the <span class='it'>Mémoires</span>, and
reviewed the whole evidence with minute care, Professor Storm
thus unhesitatingly states the results: “Kjalarnes, the northern
extremity of Vinland, becomes Cape Breton Island, specially
described as low-lying and sandy. The fiord into which the
Northmen steered, on the country becoming <span class='it'>fjorthskorit</span>, <span class='it'>i.e.</span>
‘fiord-indented,’ may have been one of the bays of Guysborough,
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
the county of Nova Scotia lying farthest to the north-east;
possibly indeed Canso Bay, or some one of the bays south
of it. Therefore much further to the south in Nova Scotia
must we seek the mouth of the river where Karlsefn made
his abortive attempt at colonisation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The west coast of
northern Vinland is characterised as a region of uninhabited
forest tracks, with few open spots, a statement admirably
agreeing with the topographical conditions distinguishing the
west coast of Cape Breton Island, which in a modern book of
travels is spoken of as ‘an unexplored and trackless land of
forests and mountains.’ Hence to the south of this region
search has to be made for the mouth of the streamlet where
Thorvald Eriksson was killed.” Various points, accordingly,
such as Salmon river, or one of the rivers flowing into Pictou
harbour, are suggested as furnishing features of resemblance
and inviting to further research.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, then, is the same problem submitted to the historical
antiquaries of Nova Scotia which those of Rhode Island took
up upwards of half a century ago, with unbounded zeal, and
very surprising results. Nor is there a “Dighton Rock”
wanting; for Nova Scotia has its inscribed stone, already
interpreted as graphic runes, replete with equally suggestive
traces of the Northmen of the tenth century. The inscribed
rock at Yarmouth has long been an object of curious interest.
So far back as 1857 I received from Dr. J. G. Farish a full-sized
copy of the inscription, with the following account of it: “The
inscription, of which the accompanying sketch is an exact copy,</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo-54.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0001' style='width:400px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Inscription, Yarmouth Rock, Nova Scotia.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'>was discovered forty-five years ago, at Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.
The rock on which the characters are engraved is about two
feet in diameter, of an irregular hemispherical shape, with one
naturally smooth surface. It lies on the shore of a small inlet,
at high-water mark, and close to the bank, on which it may
formerly have rested. The stone has been split where a very
thin vein of quartz once traversed it, but the corresponding
half could never be found. The tracing has been done with a
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
sharp-pointed instrument carried onward, by successive blows
of a hammer or mallet, the effect of which is plainly visible.
The point of the instrument barely penetrated the layer of
quartz, which is almost as thin as the black marks of the
sketch. The inscription has been shown to several learned
gentlemen,—one intimately acquainted with the characters of
the Micmac and Millicet Indians who once inhabited this
country; another, familiar with the Icelandic and other Scandinavian
languages; but no person has yet been able to decipher
it.” Again, in 1880, I received from Mr. J. Y. Bulmer, Secretary
of the Nova Scotia Historical Society, a photograph of the
Yarmouth rock, with an accompanying letter, in which he
remarks: “I am directed by the council of the Nova Scotia
Historical Society to forward to you a photographic view of
a stone found near the ocean, in Yarmouth county, N.S., and
having an inscription which, if not runic or Phœnician, is
supposed by many to be the work of man. As ancient remains
are most likely to be preserved by calling attention to all such
works and inscriptions, we thought it best to forward it to you,
where it could be examined by yourself and others likely to
detect a fraud, or translate an inscription. The stone is now—or
was one hundred years ago,—near, or in fact on, the edge
of the sea. It has since been removed to Yarmouth for preservation.
It was found near Cape Sable, a cape that must
have been visited by nearly every navigator, whether ancient
or modern.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The earlier description of Dr. Farish is valuable, as it
preserves an account of the rock while it still occupied its
original site. He speaks, moreover, definitely as to the period
when it first attracted attention; and which, though more
recent than the “one hundred years” of my later correspondent,
or a nearly equivalent statement in the <span class='it'>Proceedings of the
American Philosophical Society</span>, that “it has been known
for nearly an hundred years,” is sufficiently remote to remove
all idea of fraud, at least by any person of the present generation.
The description given by Dr. Farish of the apparent
execution of the inscription by means of a sharp-pointed instrument—meaning
thereby no doubt a metallic tool,—and a
hammer or mallet, clearly points to other than native Indian
workmanship, whatever may have been the date of its execution.
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
As will be seen from the accompanying copy, it is in arbitrary
linear characters bearing no resemblance to the abbreviated
symbols familiar to us in Indian epigraphy; and at the same
time it may be described as unique in character. Having
been known to people resident in its vicinity for many years
before the attention of students of the early monuments of the
continent was invited to it, it appears to be beyond suspicion
of purposed fraud. I did not attempt any solution of the
enigma thus repeatedly submitted to my consideration; but it
was this graven stone that was referred to when, in the
inaugural address to the section of History and Archæology of
the Royal Society of Canada, in 1882, the remark was made:
“I know of but one inscription in Canada which seems to
suggest the possibility of a genuine native record.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On nearly every recurrence of an inscription in any linear
form of alphabetic character brought to light in the western
hemisphere, the first idea has been to suggest a Phœnician
origin; and this is, no doubt, implied in the statement of its
runic decipherer, in the <span class='it'>Proceedings of the American Philosophical
Society</span>, that “the glyphs have been at various times
copied and sent abroad to men of learning who have made
more or less attempts at deciphering them, more than one
savant seeing traces of Semitic origin.” But latterly with the
reported discovery of any linear inscription on the eastern seaboard,
the temptation has been to refer it to the Northmen of
the eleventh century. To this accordingly the allusions of
both of my Nova-Scotian correspondents pointed. But the
characters of the Scandinavian futhork are sufficiently definite
to satisfy any one familiar with Scottish and Manx runic inscriptions,
or with Professor George Stephens’ ample illustrations
of them as they are found in the native home of the
Northmen, that it is vain to look to either for a key to the
graven legend on the Yarmouth rock. The presence of the
Northmen, not only in Iceland and Greenland, but as transient
visitors on some portion of the North American mainland, now
rests on satisfactory historical evidence. In Greenland they
left indisputable literate records of their colonisation of the
region to which they gave the inapt name it still retains.
The runic inscriptions brought to Copenhagen in 1831 not
only determine the sites of settlements effected by the companions
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
and successors of Eric, but they serve to show the
kind of evidence to be looked for, alike to the north and the
south of the St. Lawrence, if any traces yet survive of their
having attempted to colonise the old Markland and Vinland,
whether the latter is recovered in Nova Scotia or New
England. Their genuine memorials are not less definite than
those left by the Romans in Gaul or Britain; and corresponding
traces of them in the assumed Vinland, and elsewhere in the
United States, have been perseveringly, but vainly, sought for.
One unmistakably definite Scandinavian inscription, that of the
“Huidœrk,” professedly found on the river Potomac, does not
lay claim to serious criticism. It was affirmed to have been
discovered in 1867 graven on a rock on the banks of the
Potomac; but to any student familiar with the genuine
examples figured in the <span class='it'>Antiquitates Americanæ</span>, it will be
readily recognised as a clever hoax, fabricated by the correspondent
of the <span class='it'>Washington Union</span> out of genuine Greenland
inscriptions. It reads thus: <span class='sc'>hir huilir syasy fagrharrdr
avstfirthingr iki a kildi systr thorg samfethra halfthritgr
gleda gvd sal henar</span>. To this are added certain
symbols, suggested it may be presumed by the Kingiktorsoak
inscription, from which the translator professes to derive the
date <span class='sc'>a.d.</span> 1051.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the interval between the dates of the two communications
previously referred to, a rubbing of the inscription on the
Yarmouth rock was forwarded to Mr. Henry Phillips jr., of
Philadelphia. It appears to have been under consideration by
him at intervals for nine years, when at length it was made
the subject of a paper read before the American Philosophical
Society, and printed in its <span class='it'>Proceedings</span> in 1884. After a
description of the locality, and the discovery of the inscribed
stone on its original site, “about the end of the last century,
by a man named Fletcher,” Mr. Phillips states the reasons
which sufficed to satisfy him that the inscription is a genuine
one. He then proceeds thus: “Having become imbued with
a belief that no deception was intended, or practised, I entered
upon the study of the markings with a mind totally and
entirely free from prejudice. So far from believing that the
inscription was a relic of the pre-Columbian discovery of
America, I had never given any credence to that theory.”
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
Thus, not only entirely unbiassed, but, as he says, “somewhat
prejudiced against the authenticity of any inscription on this
continent purporting to emanate from the hardy and intrepid
Norsemen,” he proceeded to grapple with the strange characters.
“As in a kaleidoscope, word after word appeared in disjointed
form, and each was in turn rejected, until at last an intelligible
word came forth, followed by another and another,
until a real sentence with a meaning stood forth to my
astonished gaze: <span class='it'>Harkussen men varu</span>—Hako’s son addressed
the men.” On reverting to the old Vinland narrative this
seemed all unexpectedly to tally with it, for Mr. Phillips found
that in the expedition of Thorfinn Karlsefne, in 1007, one
named Haki occurs among those who accompanied him. Still
more noteworthy, as it appears, though overlooked by him,
this oldest record of a European visitor to the Nova-Scotian
shores, if actually referable to Hake, the fellow-voyager of
Thorfinn, was no Northman, but a Scot! For Thorfinn himself,
the old Saga, as reproduced in the <span class='it'>Antiquitates Americanæ</span>,
claims a comprehensive genealogy in which his own Scottish
ancestry is not overlooked. In the summer of 1006, according
to the narrative of the “settlement effected in Vinland by
Thorfinn,” “there arrived in Greenland two ships from Iceland;
the one was commanded by Thorfinn, having the very significant
surname of Karlsefn (<span class='it'>i.e.</span> who promises, or is destined to be an
able or great man), a wealthy and powerful man, of illustrious
lineage, and sprung from Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Irish and
Scottish ancestors, some of whom were kings of royal descent.
He was accompanied by Snorre Thorbrandson, who was also a
man of distinguished lineage. The other ship was commanded
by Bjarne Grimolfson, of Breidefiord, and Thorhall Gamlison, of
Austfiord. They kept the festival of Yule at Brattalid.
Thorfinn became enamoured of Gudrida, and obtained the consent
of her brother-in-law, Leif, and their marriage was
celebrated during the winter. On this, as on former occasions,
the voyage to Vinland formed a favourite theme of conversation,
and Thorfinn was urged both by his wife and others to
undertake such a voyage. It was accordingly resolved on in
the spring of 1007.” This later narrative distinctly sets forth
an organised scheme of permanent settlement in the tempting
land of the vine. Thorvald, who was in command of one of
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
the three ships fitted out for the expedition, was married to
Freydisa, a natural daughter of Eric the Red. “On board this
ship was also a man of the name of Thorhall, who had long
served Eric as a huntsman in summer, and as house-steward
in winter, and who had much acquaintance with the uncolonised
parts of Greenland. They had in all 160 men. They took
with them all kinds of live stock, it being their intention to
establish a colony, if possible.” Then follows the notice of
their observations of the characteristic features, and of the
fauna and flora of Helluland, Markland, and subsequent points;
to the last of which, characterised by “trackless deserts and
long beaches with sands,” they gave the name of Furdustrandir.
After passing this, the characteristic feature is noted that the
land began to be indented by inlets, or bays. Then follows
the notice of Hake, the Scot, to whom Mr. Phillips conceives
the Yarmouth inscription may be due. The reference,
accordingly, with its accompanying description of the country,
has a special claim to notice here. “They had,” says the Saga,
“two Scots with them, Haki and Hekia, whom Leif had
formerly received from the Norwegian King, Olaf Tryggvason,”
it may be assumed as slaves carried off in some marauding
expedition to the British Islands. The two Scots, man and
woman, it is added, “were very swift of foot. They put them
on shore recommending them to proceed in a south-west
direction, and explore the country. After the lapse of three
days they returned, bringing with them some grapes and ears
of wheat, which grew wild in that region. They continued
their course until they came to a place where the firth penetrated
far into the country. Off the mouth of it was an island
past which there ran strong currents, which was also the case
further up the firth. On the island there was an immense
number of eider ducks, so that it was scarcely possible to walk
without treading on their eggs. They called the island
Straumey (Stream Isle), and the firth Straumfiordr (Stream
Firth). They landed on the shore of this firth, and made
preparations for their winter residence. The country was
extremely beautiful,” as we may readily imagine a sheltered
nook of Nova Scotia to have appeared to voyagers fresh from
Iceland and the Greenland shores. It may be well to note here
that the incident of the discovery of the vine and the gathering
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
of grapes reappears in different narratives under varying forms.
It was a feature to be specially looked for by all later voyagers
in search of the Vinland of the first expedition, that set out in
search for the southern lands of which Bjarni Herjulfson is
reported to have brought back an account to Greenland. Nor
is the discovery of the vine by successive explorers along the
American seaboard in any degree improbable, though it can
scarcely be doubted that some of the later accounts are mere
amplifications of the original narrative. It is, at any rate, to
be noted that the scene of Haki the Scot’s discovery, was not
the Hóp, identified by the Rhode Island Historical Society with
their own Mount Hope Bay. As for Thorhall and his shipmates,
they turned back, northward, in search of Vinland, and
so deserted their fellow-voyagers before the scene of attempted
colonisation was reached, and were ultimately reported to have
been wrecked on the Irish coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such is the episode in the narrative of ancient explorations
of the North American shores by voyagers from Greenland, in
which Mr. Phillips was gratified by the startling conformity, as
it seemed to him, of the name of Haki, with the Harkussen of
his runes; though, it must be admitted, the identity is far from
complete. If, however, there were no doubt as to the inscription
being a genuine example of Northern runes, the failure to
refer them to Hake, or any other specific member of an exploring
party, would be of little moment. Here, at any rate,
was evidence which, if rightly interpreted, was calculated to
suggest a reconsideration of the old localisation of Vinland in
the state of Rhode Island; and to this other evidence pointed
even more clearly. Reassured, accordingly, by a study of the
map, which shows the comparatively trifling distance traversed
by the assumed voyagers from Greenland, when compared with
that from their remote European fatherland, Mr. Phillips submitted
his interpretation to the American Philosophical Society
“as worthy of consideration, if not absolutely convincing.”
To the topographer of the maritime coasts of Canada, a genuine
runic inscription which proved that Norse voyagers from
Greenland did actually land on the shores of Nova Scotia,
in <span class='sc'>a.d.</span> 1007, and leave there a literate record of their visit,
would be peculiarly acceptable. But whatever be the significance
of the Yarmouth inscription, it fails to satisfy such
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
requirements. It neither accords with the style, or usual
formula of runic inscriptions; nor, as will be seen from the
accompanying facsimile, is it graven in any variation of the
familiar characters of the Scandinavian futhork. The fascinating
temptation has to be set aside; and the Hake or
Harkussen of its modern interpreter must take rank with the
illusory Thorfinn discovered by the Rhode Island antiquaries
on their famed Dighton Rock, which still stands by the banks
of the Taunton river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is indeed vain for us to hope for evidence of the same
definite kind as that which establishes beyond question the
presence of the Northmen on the sites of their long-settled
colonies in Greenland. Their visits to the Canadian seaboard
were transitory; and any attempt at settlement there failed.
Yet without the definite memorials of the old Norse colonists
recovered in the present century on the sites of their Greenland
settlements, it would probably have proved vain to
identify them now. The coast of Nova Scotia is indented
with inlets, and estuaries of creeks and rivers, suggesting
some vague resemblance to the Hóp, or creek of the old
Sagas. Whether any one of them presents adequate features
for identification with the descriptions furnished in their
accounts has yet to be ascertained. But there is every
motive to stimulate us to a careful survey of the coast in
search of any probable site of the Vinland of the old Northmen.
Slight as are the details available for such a purpose,
they are not without some specific definiteness, which the
Rhode Island antiquaries turned to account, not without a
warning to us in their too confident assumption of results.
Dr. E. B. Tylor, in his address to the section of anthropology
at the Montreal meeting of the British Association, after
referring to the Icelandic records of the explorations of the
hardy sea-rovers from Greenland, as too consistent to be
refused belief as to the main facts, thus proceeded: “They
sailed some way down the American coast. But where are
we to look for the most southerly points which the Sagas
mention as reached in Vineland? Where was Keel-ness
where Thorvald’s ship ran aground, and Cross-ness where he
was buried when he died by the Skræling’s arrow? Rafn, in
the <span class='it'>Antiquitates Americanæ</span>, confidently maps out these places
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
about the promontory of Cape Cod, in Massachusetts, and this
has been repeated since from book to book. I must plead
guilty to having cited Rafn’s map before now, but when with
reference to the present meeting I consulted our learned
editor of Scandinavian records at Oxford, Mr. Gudbrand
Vigfusson, and afterwards went through the original passages
in the Sagas with Mr. York Powell, I am bound to say that
the voyages of the Northmen ought to be reduced to more
moderate limits. It appears that they crossed from Greenland
to Labrador (Helluland), and thence sailing more or
less south and west, in two stretches of two days each, they
came to a place near where wild grapes grew, whence they
called the country Vineland. This would, therefore, seem to
have been somewhere about the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and it
would be an interesting object for a yachting cruise to try
down from the east coast of Labrador a fair four days’ sail of
a Viking ship, and identify, if possible, the sound between the
island and the ness, the river running out of the lake into the
sea, the long stretches of sand, and the other local features
mentioned in the Sagas.” A fresh stimulus is thus furnished
to Canadian yachtsmen to combine historical exploration with
a summer’s coasting trip, and go in search of the lost Vinland.
The description of the locality that furnished the data from
which the members of the Rhode Island Historical Society
satisfied themselves as to the identity of their more southern
site on the Pacasset river, has to be kept in view in any
renewed inquiry. At the same time it must not be overlooked
that the oldest and most trustworthy narrative, in the
Saga of Eric the Red, with the credited, and probably genuine
story of the voyage of Karlsefne, are expanded, in the Grænlendingathàttr,
into five voyages, with their incidents recast
with modifications and additions. The expedition of Leif
Ericson, and his accidental discovery of Vinland, and the
subsequent attempt at colonisation of Karlsefne, in company
with Thorvald and Freydisa, are the only adventures accredited
by the oldest tradition. In the latter narrative it is stated
that “they sailed for a long time, until they came at last to a
river which flowed down from the land into a lake, and so
into the sea. There were great bars at the mouth of the river,
so that it could only be entered at the height of the flood tide.
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
Karlsefn and his men sailed into the mouth of the river,
and called it Hóp,” <span class='it'>i.e.</span> a land-locked bay. “They found self-sown
wheat fields wherever there were hollows, and where
there was hilly ground there were vines.” Subsequent descriptions
are obviously based on this account. But to whatever
extent the description of the locality where Thorvald,
the brother of Leif Ericson, was killed by a Skræling may
have been suggested by that narrative, the localities are
different. It was apparently in the spring of <span class='sc'>a.d.</span> 1004 that
Karlsefne set out on his colonising expedition. The voyagers
sailed along Furdustrandir, a long, low sandy coast, till they
came to where the land was indented with creeks and inlets.
There they steered into the Straumsfjord, to a spot where
Karlsefne and his companions spent the winter of <span class='sc'>a.d.</span> 1005;
and where, therefore, we may assume the observations to have
been made that determined the length of the day in Vinland
at the winter solstice. The narrative of noteworthy incidents
is accompanied with topographical details that have to be kept
in view in any attempt at recovering traces of the locality.
There, if it could be identified, we have to look for a promontory
answering to the Krossanes, or promontory of the crosses:
the spot where Thorvald was buried; and as would seem to be
implied, where a cross was set up at the grave mound. The
style of such a sepulchral memorial of the Northmen at a
little later date is very familiar to us. The discovery on some
hitherto unheeded spot of the Nova-Scotian coast of a bautastein,
graven like those recovered on the sites of the old
Greenland colony, would be an invaluable historical record.
It might be expected to read somewhat in this fashion: <span class='it'>Leif
sunr Erikr rautha raisti krus thana eftir Thorvald brothur
sina</span>. But there is slight ground for imagining that the
transient visitors from Greenland to the Canadian shores left
any more lasting memorial of the tragic event that reappears
in successive versions of the narrative of their presence there,
than a wooden grave-post, or uninscribed headstone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One other element in the characteristic features of the
strange land visited by the Greenland explorers is the native
population, and this has a specific interest in other respects, in
addition to its bearing on the determination of a Nova-Scotian
site for “Vineland the Good.” They are designated Skrælings
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
(Skrælingjar), and as in this the Greenland voyagers applied
the same name to the natives of Vinland as to the Greenland
Eskimo, it has been assumed that both were of the same race.
But the term “skræling” is still used in Norway to express the
idea of decrepitude, or physical inferiority; and probably was
used with no more definite significance than our own word
“savage.” The account given in the Saga of the approach of
the Skrælings would sufficiently accord with that of a Micmac
flotilla of canoes. Their first appearance is thus described:
“While looking about one morning, they observed a great
number of canoes. On exhibiting friendly signals the canoes
approached nearer to them, and the natives in them looked
with astonishment at those they met there. These people
were sallow-coloured and ill-looking, had ugly heads of hair,
large eyes and broad cheeks.” The term <span class='it'>skræling</span> has usually
been interpreted “dwarf,” and so seemed to confirm the idea
of the natives having been Eskimo; but, as already stated, the
word, as still used in Norway, might mean no more than the
inferiority of any savage race. As to the description of their
features and complexion, that would apply equally well to the
red Indian or the Eskimo, and so far as the eyes are spoken
of, rather to the former than the latter. More importance
may be attached to the term <span class='it'>hudhkeipr</span> applied to their canoes,
which is more applicable to the kayak, or skin-boat, than to
the birch-bark canoe of the Indian; but the word was probably
loosely used as applicable to any savage substitute for a keel,
or built boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This question of the identification of the Skrælings, or
natives, whether of Nova Scotia or New England, is one of
considerable ethnographic significance. The speculations
relative to the possible relationship of the Eskimo to the
post-glacial cave-dwellers of the Dordogne valley, and their
consequent direct descent from palæolithic European man,
confer a value on any definite evidence bearing on their
movements in intermediate centuries. On the other hand,
the approximate correspondence of the Huron-Iroquois of
Canada and the state of New York to the Eskimo in the
dolichocephalic type of skull common to both, gives an
interest to any evidence of the early presence of the latter
to the south of the St. Lawrence. In their western migrations
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
the Eskimo attract the attention of the ethnographer as the
one definite ethnic link between America and Asia. They
are met with, as detached and wandering tribes, across the
whole continent, from Greenland to Behring Strait. Nevertheless,
they appear to be the occupants of a diminishing
rather than an expanding area. This would accord with the
idea of their area extending over the Canadian maritime provinces,
and along the New England coast, in the eleventh century;
and possibly as indicating the early home, from which
they were being driven northward by the Huron-Iroquois or
other assailants, rather than implying an overflow from their
Arctic habitat. Seal hunting on the coast of Newfoundland,
and fishing on its banks and along the shores of Nova Scotia,
would even now involve no radical change in the habits of the
Eskimo. It was with this hyperborean race that the Scandinavian
colonists of Greenland came in contact 800 years ago,
and by them that they were exterminated at a later
date. If it could be proved that the Skrælings of the eleventh
century, found by the Northmen on the American mainland,
were Eskimo, it would furnish the most conclusive evidence
that the red Indians—whether Micmac, Millicet, or Hurons,—are
recent intruders there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In any process of aggression of the native American race
on the older area of the Eskimo, some intermixture of blood
would naturally follow. The slaughter of the males in battle,
and the capture of women and children, everywhere leads to
a like result; and this seems the simplest solution of the
problem of the southern brachycephalic, and the northern
dolichocephalic type of head among native American races.
When the sites of the ancient colonies of Greenland were
rediscovered and visited by the Danes, they imagined they
could recognise in the physiognomy of some of the Eskimo
who still people the shores of Davis Straits, traces of admixture
between the old native and the Scandinavian or
Icelandic blood. Of the Greenland colonies the Eskimo had
perpetuated many traditions, referring to the colonists under
the native name of <span class='it'>Kablunet</span>. But of the language that had
been spoken among them for centuries, the fact is highly
significant that the word <span class='it'>Kona</span>, used by them as a synonym
for woman, is the only clearly recognised trace. This is
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
worthy of note, in considering the distinctive character of the
Eskimo language, and its comparison with the Indian languages
of the North American continent. It has the feature common
to nearly all the native languages of the continent north of
the Mexican Gulf in the composite character of its words; so
that an Eskimo verb may furnish the equivalent to a whole
sentence in other tongues. But what is specially noteworthy
is that, while the Huron-Iroquois, the Algonkin, and other
Indian families of languages have multiplied widely dissimilar
dialects, Dr. Henry Rink has shown that the Eskimo dialects
of Greenland or Labrador differ slightly from those of Behring
Strait; and the congeners of the American Eskimo, who have
overflowed into the Aleutian Islands, and taken possession of
the north-eastern region of Asia, perpetuate there nearly allied
dialects of the parent tongue.<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a> The Alaskan and the Tshugazzi
peninsulas are in part peopled by Eskimo; the Konegan of
Kudjak Island belong to the same stock; and all the dialects
spoken in the Aleutian Islands, the supposed highway from
Asia to America, betray in like manner the closest affinities
to the Arctic Mongolidæ of the New World. They thus
appear not only to be contributions from the New World to
the Old, but to be of recent introduction there. If the cave-dwellers
of Europe’s palæolithic era found their way as has
been suggested, in some vastly remote age, either by an
eastern or a western route to the later home of the Arctic
Eskimo, it is in comparatively modern centuries that the tide
of migration has set westward across the Behring Strait, and
by the Aleutian Islands, into Asia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reference to the Skrælings in the first friendly intercourse
of Thorfinn Karlsefne and his companions with the
natives, and their subsequent hostile attitude, ending in the
death of Thorvald Ericson, has given occasion to this digression.
But the question thus suggested is one of no secondary
interest. If we could certainly determine their ethnical
character the fact would be of great significance; and coupled
with any well-grounded determination of the locality where the
fatal incident occurred, would have important bearings on
American ethnology. The description of the sallow, or more
correctly, swarthy coloured, natives with large eyes, broad cheek-bones,
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
shaggy hair, and forbidding countenances is furnished
in the Saga, and then the narrative thus proceeds: “After the
Skrælings had gazed at them for a while, they rowed away
again to the south-west past the cape. Karlsefne and his
company had erected their dwelling-houses a little above the
bay, and there they spent the winter. No snow fell, and the
cattle found their food in the open field. One morning early,
in the beginning of 1008, they descried a number of canoes
coming from the south-west past the cape. Karlsefne having
held up the white shield as a friendly signal, they drew nigh
and immediately commenced bartering. These people chose
in preference red cloth, and gave furs and squirrel skins in
exchange. They would fain also have bought swords and
spears, but these Karlsefne and Snorre prohibited their people
from selling to them. In exchange for a skin entirely gray
the Skrælings took a piece of cloth of a span in breadth, and
bound it round their heads. Their barter was carried on in
this way for some time. The Northmen then found that their
cloth was beginning to grow scarce, whereupon they cut it up
in smaller pieces, not broader than a finger’s breadth, yet the
Skrælings gave as much for these smaller pieces as they had
formerly given for the larger ones, or even more. Karlsefne
also caused the women to bear out milk soup, and the Skrælings
relishing the taste of it, they desired to buy it in preference to
everything else, so they wound up their traffic by carrying
away their bargains in their bellies. Whilst this traffic was
going on it happened that a bull, which Karlsefne had brought
along with him, came out of the wood and bellowed loudly.
At this the Skrælings got terrified and rushed to their canoes,
and rowed away southwards. About this time Gudrida,
Karlsefne’s wife, gave birth to a son, who received the name
of Snorre. In the beginning of the following winter the
Skrælings came again in much greater numbers; they showed
symptoms of hostility, setting up loud yells. Karlsefne caused
the red shield to be borne against them, whereupon they
advanced against each other, and a battle commenced. There
was a galling discharge of missiles. The Skrælings had a sort
of war sling. They elevated on a pole a tremendously large
ball, almost the size of a sheep’s stomach, and of a bluish
colour; this they swung from the pole over Karlsefne’s people,
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
and it descended with a fearful crash. This struck terror into
the Northmen, and they fled along the river.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was thus apparent that in spite of the attractions of the
forest-clad land, with its tempting vines, there was little
prospect of peaceful possession. The experience of these
first colonisers differed in no degree from that of the later
pioneers of Nova Scotia or New England. Freydisa, the
natural daughter of Eric, whom Thorvald had wedded, is
described as taunting the men for their cowardice in giving
way before such miserable caitiffs as the Skrælings or savage
natives, and vowing, if she had only a weapon, she would show
better fight. “She accordingly followed them into the wood.
There she encountered a dead body. It was Thorbrand
Snorrason. A flat stone was sticking fast in his head. His
naked sword lay by his side. This she took up, and prepared
to defend herself. She uncovered her breasts and dashed them
against the naked sword. At this sight the Skrælings became
terrified, and ran off to their canoes. Karlsefne and the rest
now came up to her and praised her courage. But Karlsefne
and his people became aware that, although the country held
out many advantages, still the life that they would have to
lead here would be one of constant alarm from the hostile
attacks of the natives. They therefore made preparations for
departure with the resolution of returning to their own
country.” To us the attractions of a Nova-Scotian settlement
might seem worth encountering a good many such assaults
rather than retreat to the ice-bound shores of Greenland. But
it was “their own country”; their relatives were there. Nor
to the hardy Northmen did its climate, or that of Iceland,
present the forbidding aspect which it would to us. So they
returned to Brattalid, carrying back with them an evil report
of the land; and, as it seems, also bringing with them specimens
of its natives. For, on their homeward voyage, they
proceeded round Kialarnes, and then were driven to the nort-west.
“The land lay to larboard of them. There were thick
forests in all directions as far as they could see, with scarcely
any open space. They considered the hills at Hope and those
which they now saw as forming part of one continuous range.
They spent the third winter at Streamfirth. Karlsefne’s son
Snorre was now three years of age. When they sailed from
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
Vinland they had southerly wind, and came to Markland,
where they met with five Skrælings. They caught two of
them (two boys), whom they carried away along with them,
and taught them the Norse language, and baptized them;
these children said that their mother was called Vethilldi and
their father Uvaege. They said that the Skrælings were ruled
by chieftains (kings), one of whom was called Avalldamon,
and the other Valdidida; that there were no houses in the
country, but that the people dwelled in holes and caverns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus ended the abortive enterprise of Thorfinn and his
company to found, in the eleventh century, a colony of Northmen
on the American mainland. The account the survivors
brought back told indeed of umbrageous woodland and the
tempting vine. But the forest was haunted by the fierce
Skrælings, and its coasts open to assault from their canoes.
To the race that wrested Normandy from the Carlovingian
Frank, and established its jarldoms in Orkney, Caithness, and
Northumbria, such a foe might well be deemed contemptible.
But the degenerate Franks, and the Angles of Northumbria,
tempted the Norse marauder with costly spoils; and only
after repeated successful expeditions awakened the desire to
settle in the land and make there new homes. Alike to
explorers seeking for themselves a home, and to adventurers
coveting the victors’ spoils, the Vinland of the Northmen
offered no adequate temptation, and so its traditions faded out
of memory, or were recalled only as the legend of a fabulous
age. At the meeting of the British Association at Montreal
in 1884 Mr. R. G. Halliburton read a paper entitled “A
Search in British North America for lost Colonies of Northmen
and Portuguese.” Documents were quoted by him showing
that from <span class='sc'>a.d.</span> 1500 to 1570 commissions were regularly
issued to the Corte Reals and their successors. Cape Breton
was colonised by them in 1521; and when Portugal became
annexed to Spain in 1680, and Terra Nova passed with it
to her rule, she sent colonists to settle there. The site which
they occupied, Mr. Halliburton traced to Spanish Harbour
(Sydney), Cape Breton, and this he claimed to be the earliest
European settlement in North America. For, as for the
Northmen’s reputed explorations and attempt at settlement, his
verdict is thus briefly summed up: “When we can discover
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
Greenland’s verdant mountains we can also hope to find the
vine-clad hills of Vineland the Good.” That, however, is too
summary a dismissal of evidence which, if vague, is to every
appearance based on authorities as seemingly authentic and
trustworthy as those on which many details of the history of
early centuries rest. It would manifestly be unwise to discountenance
further inquiry by any such sweeping scepticism,
or to discourage the hope that local research may yet be rewarded
by evidence confirmatory of the reputed visit of Thorfinn
and his fellow-explorers to some recognisable point on the
Nova-Scotian coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The diligent research of scholars familiar with the Old
Norse, in which the Sagas are written, is now clearing this
inquiry into reputed pre-Columbian discovery and colonisation
of much misapprehension. The extravagant assumptions alike
of earlier Danish and New England antiquaries in dealing with
the question were provocative of an undue bias of critical
scepticism. The American historian Bancroft gave form to
this tendency when he affirmed that “the story of the colonisation
of America by Northmen rests on narratives mythological
in form and obscure in meaning; ancient, yet not contemporary.”
If the historian had adduced in evidence of this the
story of the Eyrbyggja Saga, and the later amplifications of
reputed voyages to “White Man’s Land,” and to “Newland,”
his language would have been pardonable. Of the later fictitious
Sagas are the Landvætta-sögur; Stories of the guardian-spirits
of the land; and the Saga of Halfdan Eysteinsson, from
which we learn that “Raknar brought the deserts of Heluland
under his rule, and destroyed all the giants there”; or again
we have the Saga of “Barthar Snæfellsass,” or the Snow-fell
God, and the King Dumbr of Dumbshaf. But all such
mythical Sagas belong to later Icelandic and Norwegian literature,
and have no claim to historical value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The genuine documentary evidence of Vinland is recoverable
from manuscripts of earlier date, and a widely different
character. Had Bancroft been familiar with the early Icelandic
Sagas he could never have spoken of them as mythological.
They are, on the contrary, distinguished by their presentation
of events in an extremely simple and literal manner; equally
free from rhetorical embellishment and the extravagances of
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
the romancer. But the occupation of the new-found land
was brief; and as the tale of its explorers faded from the
memory of younger generations, fancy toyed with the legend
of a sunny land of the Vine, with its self-sown fields of
ripened grain. At a later date Greenland itself vanished from
the ken of living men; and romance sported with the fancies
suggested by its name as a fertile oasis of green pastures
walled in by the ice and snows of its Arctic zone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first authentic reference, now recoverable, to Vinland
the Good has already been referred to. It occurs in a passage
in the <span class='it'>Iselandinga Vók</span>, by Ari Thorgilsson, the oldest Icelandic
historiographer. Ari, surnamed froði, or the learned, was born
<span class='sc'>a.d.</span> 1067, and survived till 1148. The earliest manuscript
of the Saga of Eric the Red dates as late as <span class='sc'>a.d.</span> 1330. It
is contained in the Arna Magnæan Codex, commonly known as
<span class='it'>Hauks Vók</span>. Hauk Erlendsson, to whom the preservation
of this copy of the original Saga is due, and by whom part
of it appears to have been written, has appended to the manuscript
a genealogy, in which he traces his descent from the
son of Karlsefne, born in Vinland. Two versions of the
narrative have been preserved, differing only in slight details;
and of those Reeves says: “They afford the most graphic and
succinct exposition of the discovery; and, supported as they
are throughout by contemporary history, appear in every
respect most worthy of credence.”<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a> The simple, unadorned
narrative bears out the idea that it is a manuscript of information
derived from the statements of the actual explorers.
The later story of Barni Herjulfson,—an obvious amplification
of the original narrative, with a change of names, and many
spurious additions,—occurs in the Flatey Book, a manuscript
written before the close of the fourteenth century, when the
Northmen of the Scandinavian fatherland were reawakening
to an interest in the memories or traditions of early voyages
to strange lands beyond the Atlantic Ocean, and fashioning
them into legend and romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poet, William Morris, represents the Vikings of the
fourteenth century following the old leadings of Leif Ericson
in search of the earthly paradise:—
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span></p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The time chosen is that of England’s Edward III., and, still
more, of England’s Chaucer. But in reality all memory of the
land which lay beyond the waters of the Atlantic had faded
as utterly from the minds of Europe’s mariners, in that fourteenth
century, as in the older days when Plato restored a
lost Atlantis to give local habitation to his ideal Republic.
When the idea revived in the closing years of the fifteenth
century, not as a philosophic dream, but as a legitimate induction
of science, the reception which it met with from the
embodied wisdom of that age, curiously illustrates the common
experience of the pioneers in every path of novel discovery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Columbus, with his well-defined faith in the form of
the earth which gave him confidence to steer boldly westward
in search of the Asiatic Cipango: the existence of a continent
beyond the Atlantic was no mere possibility. So early, at
least, as 1474 he had conceived the design of reaching Asia
by sailing to the West; and in that year he is known to
have expounded his plans to Paolo Toscanelli, the learned
Florentine physician and cosmographer, and to have received
from him hearty encouragement. Assuming the world to
be a sphere, he fortunately erred alike in under-estimating
its size, and in over-estimating the extent to which the
continent of Asia stretched eastward. In this way he
diminished the distance between the coasts of Europe and
Asia; and so, when at length he sighted the new-found land
of the West, so far from dreaming of another ocean wider than
the Atlantic between him and the object of his quest, he
unhesitatingly designated the natives of Guanahani, or San
Salvador, “Indians,” in the confident belief that this was an
outlying coast of Asiatic India. Nor was his reasoning
unsound. He sought, and would have found, a western route
to that old east by the very track he followed, had no
American continent intervened. It was not till his third
voyage that the great Admiral for the first time beheld the
new continent,—not indeed the Asiatic mainland, nor even
the northern continent,—but the embouchures of the Orinoco
river, with its mighty volume of fresh water, proving beyond
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
dispute that it drained an area of vast extent, and opened up
access far into the interior of a new world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Columbus had realised his utmost anticipations, and died
in the belief that he had reached the eastern shores of Asia.
Nor is the triumph in any degree lessened by this assumption.
The dauntless navigator, pushing on ever westward into the
mysterious waters of the unexplored Atlantic in search of the
old East, presents one of the most marvellous examples of intelligent
faith that science can adduce. To estimate all that
it implied, we have to turn back to a period when his
unaccomplished purpose rested solely on that sure and well-grounded
faith in the demonstrations of science.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the city of Salamanca there assembled in the Dominican
convent of San Esteban, in the year 1487, a learned and
orthodox conclave, summoned by Prior Fernando de Talavera,
to pronounce judgment on the theory propounded by
Columbus; and to decide whether in that most catholic of
Christian kingdoms, on the very eve of its final triumph
over the infidel, it was a permissible belief that the Western
World had even a possible existence. Columbus set before
them the scientific demonstration which constituted for himself
indisputable evidence of an ocean highway across the Atlantic
to the continent beyond. The clerical council included professors
of mathematics, astronomy, and geography, as well
as other learned friars and dignitaries of the Church: probably
as respectable an assemblage of cloister-bred pedantry
and orthodox conservatism as that fifteenth century could
produce. Philosophical deductions were parried by a quotation
from St. Jerome or St. Augustine; and mathematical
demonstrations by a figurative text of Scripture; and in spite
alike of the science and the devout religious spirit of Columbus,
the divines of Salamanca pronounced the idea of the earth’s
spherical form to be heterodox; and declared a belief in
antipodes incompatible with the historical traditions of the
Christian faith: since to assert that there were inhabited
lands on the opposite side of the globe would be to maintain
that there were nations not descended from Adam, it being
impossible for them to have passed the intervening ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may naturally excite a smile to thus find the very
ethnological problem of this nineteenth century thus dogmatically
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
produced four centuries earlier to prove that America
was an impossibility. But in reality this ethnological problem
long continued in all ways to affect the question.
Among the various evidences which Columbus adduced in
confirmation of his belief in the existence of a continent
beyond the Atlantic, was the report brought to him by his
own brother-in-law, Pedro Correa, that the bodies of two
dead men had been cast ashore on the island of Flores,
differing essentially from any known race, “very broad-faced,
and diverse in aspect from Christians”; and, in truth, the
more widely they differed from all familiar Christian
humanity, the more probable did their existence appear to
the men of that fifteenth century. Hence Shakespeare’s
marvellous creation of his Caliban. Upwards of a century
and half had then elapsed since Columbus returned with the
news of a world beyond the Western Ocean; yet still to the
men of Shakespeare’s day, the strange regions of which
Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, Gomara, Lane, Harriot, and
Raleigh wrote, seemed more fitly occupied by Calibans, and
the like rude approximations to humanity, than by men and
women in any degree akin to ourselves. Othello indeed only
literally reproduces Raleigh’s account of a strange people
on the Caoro, in Guiana. He had not, indeed, himself got
sight of those marvellous Ewaipanoma, though anxious enough
to do so. Their eyes, as reported, were in their shoulders,
and their mouths in the middle of their breasts. But the
truth could not be doubted, since every child in the provinces
of Arromaia and Canuri affirmed the same. The founder of
Virginia, assuredly one of the most sagacious men of that
wise Elizabethan era, and with all the experience which travel
supplies, reverts again and again to this strange new-world
race, as to a thing of which he entertained no doubt. The
designation of Shakespeare’s Caliban, is but an anagram of
the epithet which Raleigh couples with the specific designation
of those monstrous dwellers on the Caoro. “To the west of
Caroli,” he says, “are divers nations of Cannibals, and of those
Ewaipanoma without heads.” Of “such men, whose head
stood in their breasts,” Gonsalo, in <span class='it'>The Tempest</span>, reminds
his companions, as a tale which every voyager brings back
“good warrant of”; and so it was in all honesty that
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
Othello entertained Desdemona with the story of his adventures:—</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>Of moving accidents by flood and field .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='line0'>And of the Cannibals that each other eat,</p>
<p class='line0'>The Anthropophagi and men whose heads</p>
<p class='line0'>Do grow beneath their shoulders.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The idea of an island-world lying in some unexplored
ocean, apart from the influences which affect humanity at
large, with beings, institutions, and a civilisation of its own,
had been the dream of very diverse minds. When indeed we
recall what the rude Norse galley of Eric the Red must have
been; and what the little “Pinta” and the “Nina” of
Columbus—the latter with a crew of only twenty-four men,—actually
were; and remember, moreover, that the pole-star
was the sole compass of the earlier explorer; there seems
nothing improbable in the assumption that the more ancient
voyagers from the Mediterranean, who claimed to have
circumnavigated Africa, and were familiar with the islands of
the Atlantic, may have found their way to the great continent
which lay beyond. Vague intimations, derived seemingly
from Egypt, encouraged the belief in a submerged island or
continent, once the seat of arts and learning, afar on the
Atlantic main. The most definite narrative of this vanished
continent is that already referred to as recorded in the
<span class='it'>Timæus</span> of Plato, on the authority of an account which
Solon had received from an Egyptian priest. According to
the latter the temple-records of the Nile preserved the traditions
of times reaching back far beyond the infantile fables of
the Greeks. Yet, even these preserved some memory of
deluges and convulsions by which the earth had been
revolutionised. In one of them the vast Island of Atlantis—a
continent larger than Libya and Asia conjoined,—had been
engulfed in the ocean which bears its name. This ocean-world
of fancy or tradition, Plato revived as the seat of his
imaginary commonwealth; and it had not long become a
world of fact when Sir Thomas More made it anew the seat of
his famous Utopia, the exemplar of “the best state and form
of a public weale.” “Unfortunately,” as the author quaintly
puts it, “neither we remembered to inquire of Raphael, the
companion of Amerike Vespuce on his third voyage, nor he to
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
tell us in what part of the new world Utopia is situate”: and
so there is no reason why we should not locate the seat of
this perfect commonwealth within the young Canadian
Dominion, so soon as it shall have merited this by the attainment
of such Utopian perfectibility in its polity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is not less curious to note the tardiness with which,
after the discovery of the New World had been placed beyond
question, its true significance was comprehended even by men
of culture, and abreast of the general knowledge of their time.
Peter Giles, indeed, citizen of Antwerp, and assumed confidant
of “Master More,” writes with well-simulated grief to the
Right Hon. Counsellor Hierome Buslyde, “as touching the
situation of the island, that is to say, in what part of the
world Utopia standeth, the ignorance and lack whereof not a
little troubleth and grieveth Master More”; but as he had
allowed the opportunity of ascertaining this important fact to
slip by, so the like uncertainty long after mystified current
ideas regarding the new-found world. Ere the “Flowers of
the Forest” had been weeded away on Flodden Hill, the
philosophers and poets of the liberal court of James IV.
of Scotland had learned in some vague way of the recent
discovery; and so the Scottish poet, Dunbar, reflecting on the
King’s promise of a benefice still unfulfilled, hints in his poem
“Of the world’s instabilitie,” that even had it come “fra
Calicut and the new-found Isle” that lies beyond “the great
sea-ocean, it might have comen in shorter while.” Upwards
of twenty years had passed since the return of the great
discoverer from his adventurous voyage; but the <span class='it'>Novus Orbis</span>
was then, and long afterwards continued to be, an insubstantial
fancy; for after nearly another twenty years had
elapsed, Sir David Lindsay, in his <span class='it'>Dreme</span>, represents Dame
Remembrance as his guide and instructor in all heavenly and
earthly knowledge; and among the rest, he says:—</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>She gart me clearly understand</p>
<p class='line0'>How that the Earth tripartite was in three;</p>
<p class='line0'>In Afric, Europe, and Asie;</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>the latter being in the Orient, while Africa and Europe still
constituted the Occident, or western world. Many famous
isles situated in “the ocean-sea” also attract his notice; but
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
“the new-found isle” of the elder poet had obviously faded
from the memory of that younger generation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another century had nearly run its course since the eye of
Columbus beheld the long-expected land, when, in 1590,
Edmund Spenser crossed the Irish Channel, bringing with him
the first three books of his <span class='it'>Faerie Queen</span>; in the introduction
to the second of which he thus defends the verisimilitude of
that land of fancy in which the scenes of his “famous antique
history” are laid:—</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Yet all these were, when no man did them know,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Yet have from wisest ages hidden been;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And later times things more unknowne shall show.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Why then should witless man so much misween</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;That nothing is but that which he hath seen?</p>

<p class='line0'>He wonder would much more; yet such to some appear.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Raleigh, the discoverer of Virginia, was Spenser’s special
friend, his “Shepherd of the Ocean,” the patron under
whose advice the poet visited England with the first instalment
of the Epic, which he dedicated to Queen Elizabeth,
“to live with the eternity of her Fame.” Yet it is obvious
that to Spenser’s fancy this western continent was then
scarcely more substantial than his own Faerie land. In truth
it was still almost as much a world apart as if Raleigh and his
adventurous crew had sailed up the blue vault of heaven, and
brought back the story of another planet on which it had
been their fortune to alight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor had such fancies wholly vanished long after the
voyage across the Atlantic had become a familiar thing. It
was in 1723 that the philosophical idealist, Berkeley,—afterwards
Bishop of Cloyne,—formulated a more definite and yet
not less visionary Utopia than that of Sir Thomas More. He
was about to organise “among the English in our Western
plantations” a seminary which was designed to train the
young American savages, make them Masters of Arts, and fit
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
instruments for the regeneration of their own people; while
the new Academy was to accomplish no less for the reformation
of manners and morals among his own race. In his
fancy’s choice he gave a preference, at first for Bermuda, or
the Summer Islands, as the site of his college; and “presents
the bright vision of an academic home in those fair lands of
the West, whose idyllic bliss poets had sung, from which
Christian civilisation might be made to radiate over this
vast continent with its magnificent possibilities in the future
history of the race of man.” It was while his mind was
preoccupied with this fine ideal “of planting Arts and
Learning in America” that he wrote the well-known lines:—</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>There shall be sung another golden age,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The rise of empire and of arts;</p>
<p class='line0'>The good and great inspiring epic rage,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The wisest heads and noblest hearts.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>Not such as Europe breeds in her decay:</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Such as she bred when fresh and young,</p>
<p class='line0'>When heavenly flame did animate her clay,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;By future poets shall be sung.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>Westward the course of empire takes its way;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The four first acts already past,</p>
<p class='line0'>A fifth shall close the drama with the day;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Time’s noblest offspring is the last.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The visionary philosopher followed up his project so far as
to transport himself—not to the Summer Islands of which
Waller had sung,—but to that same Rhode Island which
Danish and New England antiquaries were at a later date to
identify, whether rightly or not, as the Vinland of the Icelandic
Sagas. One of these ancient chroniclers had chanced to note
that, on the shortest day of the year in Vinland, they had the
sun above the horizon at <span class='it'>eykt</span> and <span class='it'>dagmat</span>; that is at their
regular evening and morning meal. Like our own term
breakfast, the names were significant and allusive. The old
Icelandic poet, Snorro Sturluson, author of the Edda and the
Sagas of the Norwegian Kings, has left on record that at his
Icelandic home eykt occurred at sunset on the first day of
winter. Professor Rafn hailed this old record as the key to
the latitude of Vinland. The Danish King, Frederick VI.,
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
sympathising in researches that reflected back honour on their
Norse ancestry, called in the aid of the Astronomer Royal;
and Professor Rafn felt authorised forthwith to instruct the
Rhode Island antiquaries that the latitude of the long-lost
Vinland was near Newport, in Narragansett Bay. Their
response, with the authenticating engravings of the world-famous
Newport stone mill, and the runes of Thorfinn on
Dighton Rock, in Rafn’s learned quarto volume, have been
the source of many a later comment, both in prose and
rhyme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all this lay in a still remote future when, in 1728,
Berkeley landed at Rhode Island with projects not unsuited to
the dream of a Vinland the Good, where a university was to
be reared as a centre of culture and regeneration for the
aborigines of the New World. The indispensable prerequisite
of needful funds had been promised him by the
English Government; but the promised grant was never
realised. Meanwhile he bought a farm, the purposed
site perhaps of his beneficent centre of intellectual life for
the Island state, and sojourned there for three years in
pleasant seclusion, leaving behind him kindly memories that
endeared him to many friends. He planned, if he did
not realise many goodly Utopias; speculated on space and
time, and objective idealism; and then bade farewell to Rhode
Island, and to his romantic dream of regenerated savages and
a renovated world. Soon after his return home the practical
fruits of his quiet sojourn beyond the Atlantic appeared in
the form of his <span class='it'>Alciphron: or the Minute Philosopher</span>; in which,
in the form of a dialogue, he discusses the varied forms of
speculative scepticism, at the very period when Pope was
embodying in his <span class='it'>Essay on Man</span> the brilliant, but superficial
philosophy which constituted the essence of thought for men
of the world in his age. It is in antithesis to such speculations
that Berkeley there advances his own theory, designed to
show that all nature is the language of God, everywhere
giving expressive utterance to the Divine thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So long as the American continent lay half revealed in its
vague obscurity, as a new world lying beyond the Atlantic,
and wholly apart from the old, it seemed the fitting site for
imaginary Vinlands, Utopias, Summer Islands, and earthly
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
paradises of all sorts: the scenes of a realised perfectibility
beyond the reach of Europe “in her decay.” Nor was the
refined metaphysical idealist the latest dreamer of such
dreams. In our own century, Southey, Coleridge, and the
little band of Bristol enthusiasts who planned their grand
pantisocratic scheme of intellectual communism, created for
themselves, with like fertile fancy, a Utopia of their own,
“where Susquehana pours his untamed stream”; and many a
later dreamer has striven after like ideal perfectibility in
“peaceful Freedom’s undivided dale.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span><h1>III<br/> TRADE AND COMMERCE IN THE STONE AGE</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> term “Stone Period” or “Stone Age” was suggested in
the early years of the present century by the antiquaries of
Denmark as the fitting designation of that primitive era in
western Europe—with its corresponding stage among diverse
peoples in widely severed regions and ages,—when the use of
metals was unknown. That there was a period in the history
of the human race, before its Tubal-cains, Vulcans, Vœlands, or
other Smith-gods appeared, when man depended on stone, bone,
ivory, shells, and wood, for the raw material out of which to
manufacture his implements and weapons, is now universally
admitted; and is confirmed by the abundant disclosures of the
drift and the caves. The simple, yet highly suggestive classification,
due to Thomsen of Copenhagen, was the first scientific
recognition of the fact, now established by evidence derived
from periods of vastly greater antiquity than the Neolithic age
of Denmark. The accumulated experience of many generations
was required before men mastered the useful service of fire in
the smelting of ores and the casting of metals. Nevertheless
it seems probable that the knowledge of fire, and its useful
service on the domestic hearth, are coeval with the existence
of man as a rational being. The evidence of its practical application
to the requirements for warmth and cooking carry us
back to the age of cave implements, including some among the
earliest known examples of man’s tool-making industry. In
connection with this subject, Sir John Evans draws attention
to some curious indications of the antiquity of the use of flint
by the fire-producer.<a id='r10'/><a href='#f10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[10]</span></sup></a> He refers to the ingenious derivation of
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
the word <span class='it'>silex</span> as given by Vincent of Beauvais, in the <span class='it'>Speculum
Naturæ</span>, “Silex est lapis durus, sic dictus eo quod ex eo
ignis exsiliat,” and he recalls a more remarkable reminiscence
of the evoking of fire in the Neolithic if not in the Palæolithic
period. Pliny informs us (lib. vii. cap. 56), that it was Pyrodes,
the son of Cilix, who first devised the way to strike fire out of
flint; “A myth,” says Sir John Evans, “which seems to point to
the use of silex and pyrites (from πῦρ) rather than of steel.” In
reality the flint and pyrites lie together in the same lower
strata of the chalk. As the ancient flint-miners sunk their
pits in search of the levels where the flint abounds they would
meet with frequent nodules of pyrites. The first grand discovery
of the fire-producer may have resulted from the use of
the pyrites as a mere hammer-stone to break up the larger
flints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But whatever was the source of this all-important discovery,
it dates among the earliest manifestations of human intelligence.
Nodules of iron pyrites have been found in the caves of France
and Belgium, among remains pertaining to the Palæolithic age,
and are among the most interesting disclosures of the greatly
more modern, though still prehistoric age of the barrows and
cairns of the Allophylian period of Britain, and of Western
Europe generally. Sir R. C. Hoare records the finding, among
the contents of a cinerary urn, in a Wiltshire barrow, “chipped
flints prepared for arrow heads, a long piece of flint, and a
<span class='it'>pyrites</span>, both evidently smoothed by usage.”<a id='r11'/><a href='#f11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[11]</span></sup></a> More recent explorers,
apprised of the significance of such discoveries, have
noted the presence of nodules of pyrites, accompanying the
personal ornaments and weapons occurring in graves of the
same age: deposited there either as tokens of regard, or more
probably with a vague idea of their utility to the dead in the
life beyond the grave. In a communication to the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland on a group of stone cists disclosed, in
1879, on the farm of Teinside, Teviotdale, Lord Rosehill thus
describes part of the contents of one of them. “It was filled
with dark-coloured earth, mixed with charcoal; and closely
intermingled in every part with fragments of bones which had
been exposed to the action of fire.” A broken urn lay about
ten inches from the top. “Close to the urn was a rounded
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
piece of metallic-looking substance, which appears to be
‘radiated iron pyrites,’ and which,” adds Lord Rosehill, “I
have myself discovered in several interments.”<a id='r12'/><a href='#f12' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[12]</span></sup></a> More recently,
in 1883, Major Colin Mackenzie reported to the same
Society the discovery of a cist and urn in the Black Isle, Ross-shire.<a id='r13'/><a href='#f13' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[13]</span></sup></a>
He thus proceeds: “Whilst gathering together the
broken pieces of the urn, a round-nosed flint-flake or scraper,
chipped at the edges, was found amongst the debris, and proved
to have a bluish tinge, as if it had been subjected to the action
of fire. Close beside it there was found a round piece of iron
pyrites, flat on one side, in shape somewhat like the half of an
egg, divided lengthways, only smaller. Dr. Joseph Anderson
at once recognised this as forming, along with the solitary flint,
nothing less than a prehistoric ‘strike-light’ apparatus.”<a id='r14'/><a href='#f14' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[14]</span></sup></a> No
flint is procurable in the locality; and after the closest search,
no other flint implement or flake was found on the site. In
communicating this interesting discovery to the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland, Major Mackenzie reviewed the disclosures
of this class in Great Britain, so far as they had been
noted by Hoare, Borlase, Bateman, Greenwell and Evans,
furnishing a tabulated statement of eleven examples, chiefly
found in barrows, and ranging over an area extending from
Cornwall to Ross-shire; and to those additions have since been
made. He draws attention to their occurrence in localities
which produce neither pyrites nor flint. But with the former,
at least, this need not surprise us. The prized and easily
transported pyrites may be looked for in any ancient barrow
or sepulchral deposit, and has probably in many cases passed
unnoted before its significance was understood. Now that this
is fully appreciated, it is seen to have been in use from the
early stages of primitive art: the very dawn of science; and
doubtless the pyrites and flint found in localities remote from
those where they occur as natural products are in most cases
due to primitive barter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Promethean myth represents the fire-bringer interposing
on behalf of a degraded race of beings whose helpless
lot had been preceded by the Hesiodic Golden, Silver, and
Bronze ages, as well as by an Heroic age of such demigods as
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
the Titan son of Iapetus. By a reverse process of evolution
from the lower to higher stages, the anthropoid, or Caliban of
archæological science, becomes the tool-maker, the tool-user,
and in the same primitive stage, the fire-maker. But the
service of fire is required by man under the most varied conditions
of life. The stone lamp with its moss wick, and the
stone kettle, are important implements in the snow-hut of the
Eskimo. On those he depends, not only for cooking, but for
his supply of water from melted snow; and without the
lighted taper of his stone lamp the indoor life of the long,
unbroken Arctic night would be passed in a rayless dungeon.
He has inherited the knowledge of the palæolithic fire-maker,
from whom, indeed, some have claimed for him direct genealogical
descent; and he generally treasures among his most
useful appliances a piece of quartz, and a nodule of pyrites,
which constitute his flint and steel. At the remote extreme
of the southern continent the same precious bequest is in use
by the Fuegians and Patagonians of Tierra del Fuego, the name
of which is a memorial of its fire-using savages. The Fuegian
makes a hearth of clay in the bottom of his rudely constructed
bark canoe, on which he habitually keeps a fire burning. He
prepares a tinder of dried moss or fungus, which is readily
ignited by the spark struck from a flinty stone by means of a
pyrites. The invaluable discovery is shared by the lowest
races. The Australian, the Andaman Islander, and other
rudest tribes of the Old and the New World, have mastered
the same great secret, and turn it to useful account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tradition may have been perpetuated from generation
to generation from the remotest dawn of human reason, or it
may have been rediscovered independently among diverse
races. But wherever the value of the pyrites in evoking the
latent spark of the flint was known, it would be a coveted
prize and a valuable object of barter. The story of the old
fire-makers is recorded still in the charcoal ashes of many an
ancient hearth; for charcoal is one of the most indestructible
of substances when buried. In the famous Kent’s Hole limestone
cavern at Torbay, Devonshire, explorers have systematically
pursued research backward from the specifically dated
stalagmitic record of “Robert Hodges, of Ireland, Feb. 20,
1688,” through Saxon, Roman, British, and Neolithic strata, to
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
the deposit where human remains lay embedded alongside of
those of the woolly rhinoceros, the mammoth, the fossil horse,
the hyæna and cave-bear. There also lay, not only the finished
implements, but the flakes and flint cores that revealed the
workshop of the primitive tool-maker, and the charcoal that
preserved the traces of his ancient fire. So, too, in the
Cromagnon rock-shelter of the Perigord, in an upper valley of
the Garonne, repeated layers of charcoal, interspersed with
broken bones and other culinary remains of the ancient cave-dwellers,
tell of the knowledge and use of fire in western
Europe’s Reindeer and Mammoth ages by palæolithic man.
Compared with such disclosures of primeval arts, the discoveries
on which the Danish archæologists based their systematising of
prehistoric remains belong, geologically speaking, to modern
eras. Denmark is underlaid essentially by Upper Cretaceous
rocks, the <span class='it'>Etage Danien</span> of most French writers, and the <span class='it'>Faxoe
Kelke</span> of German geologists. Drift clays and gravels overlie
the cretaceous rocks in many places, with more recent deposits
of sands, gravels, etc. These latter are of Neolithic age, containing
bones only of existing mammals. Palæolithic deposits,
with bones of extinct species, do not appear to have been
recognised in Denmark; nor is there any trace of the presence
of palæolithic man. Hence the field alike of Danish antiquarian
research and of archæological speculation was greatly circumscribed.
But thus precluded from the study of primitive arts
in that vague palæolithic dawn which lies outside of the
speculations of the historian, and beyond resort to classical
authorities for evidence in the interpretation of local disclosures,
the Danish antiquary escaped the temptation to many misleading
assumptions which long perplexed the archæologists of France
and England; and so his limited range has tended to facilitate
the investigations into subsequent disclosures relative to an
ampler antiquity of man and his arts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the old Roman provinces of Western Europe, the
Latin conquerors were not only accredited with whatever
showed any trace of Hellenic or Roman art, but with the sole
skill in working in iron. The Dane and Northman were
assumed to have followed in their wake with bronze, as with
runes and other essentially non-classical products; though still
the beautiful leaf-shaped sword and other choicest relics of the
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
Bronze age were not infrequently ascribed to the Romans.
But philologists had not yet assigned a place to the Celtic in
the Aryan family of languages. The Celt was not only assumed
to be the barbarous precursor, alike of Roman and Dane, but to
be the primeval man of Western Europe. Hence when the
first hoards of palæolithic flint implements were accidentally
discovered in Sussex and Kent, their Celtic or British origin
was assumed without question. But the known historic
position of the Northman on Scandinavian soil prevented the
crude application of the term “Danish” to every bronze relic
found there; and as no Roman conqueror had trodden the soil
of Denmark, the ethnology as well as the archæology of the
region was left unaffected by misleading complexities that
resulted from the presence of the Romans in Gaul and Britain.
The absence of remains of palæolithic man still further
simplified the problem; while the geology of the Danish
peninsula favoured the neolithic tool-maker. Flint abounds
there in amorphous nodules or blocks, and the nuclei, or cores,
from which a succession of flakes have been struck, are of
frequent occurrence among the relics of the Danish Stone age.
Flint is no less abundant throughout the regions of France and
England on either side of the English Channel; and there,
accordingly, alike in the caves and the river-drift, the rude,
massive flint implements of the Palæolithic era abound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The natural cleavage of flint, as also of the obsidian found
in volcanic localities in the Old and New World, so readily adapts
both materials to the manufacture of knives, lances, and arrow
heads, that they appear to have been turned to account by the
tool-maker from the dawn of rudest art. But it must not be
overlooked that obsidian is limited to volcanic regions, and
flint is no more universally available than bronze or iron. In
some countries it is rare; in still more it is entirely wanting;
and yet its peculiar aptitude for tool-making appears to have
been recognised at the earliest period; so that implements and
weapons of flint, alike of the Palæolithic and the Neolithic age,
abound in many localities where the raw material of the tool-maker
is unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only natural that the systematic study and
classification of the manufactures of the ancient workers in
flint should be first carried out in regions such as the Danish
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
peninsula, geologically related to the Cretaceous period, and
abounding in the material which most readily adapts itself to
the requirements of an implement-maker ignorant of the arts of
metallurgy. But the same inexhaustible store of raw material
was available to the “Flint-folk,” whose implements have
become so familiar by reason of more recent disclosures, of
France and England, belonging to a period when the climate,
the physical geography, and the whole animal life of Western
Europe, contrasted in every respect with anything we have
knowledge of in remotest historic times. Those rude examples
of primitive art lie alongside of the unwrought flint in such
profusion that the examples of them already accumulated in
the museums of Europe and America amount to many thousands.
But now that attention has been thus widely drawn to their
character and significance, it is found that implements of the
same class not only abound in regions geologically favourable to
their production, but they occur in nearly every country in
Europe, and on widely scattered localities in Asia and Africa,
where no such natural resources were available for their manufacture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The earliest known type of primitive flint implements,
illustrative of a class now very familiar to archæologists, was
accidentally recovered from the quaternary gravel beds of the
Thames valley, in the heart of Old London, before the close of
the seventeenth century. It is a well-made spear-pointed
implement, with an unusually tapering point, while the butt-end
is broad and roughly fashioned, so that it could be used in
the hand without any haft as a spade or hoe. The deposit in
which it lay would now be accepted as unquestionable evidence
of its Palæocosmic age; but at the date of its discovery,
the Celtic era was regarded as that to which all oldest traces
of European man pertained. This interesting relic is accordingly
described in the Sloane Catalogue of the British Museum
as “a British weapon, found with elephant’s tooth, opposite to
Black Mary’s, near Gray’s Inn Lane.” In 1797, another and
highly interesting discovery of the same class was communicated
to the Society of Antiquaries of London by one of its
members, Mr. John Frere.<a id='r15'/><a href='#f15' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[15]</span></sup></a> In this case a large number of
palæoliths were found lying at a depth of twelve feet from the
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
surface, in a gravelly soil containing fresh-water shells and
bones of great size. Subsequent excavations in the same
locality, at Hoxne, Suffolk, confirm the presence there of the
bones of the mammoth, as well as of the fossil horse and the
deer. Mr. Frere was so strongly impressed with the evidence
of antiquity that he inclined to assign the implements to a
remote age, “even beyond that of the present world.” By
this, however, he probably meant no more than M. Boucher de
Perthes, when, so recently as 1847, he entitled his volume
devoted to the corresponding discoveries in the valley of the
Somme, <span class='it'>Antiquités Celtiques et Antédiluviennes</span>. The antiquity
of man, as now understood, was then unthought of; and the
word “antediluvian” sufficed as a vague expression of remote
indefinite antiquity for which pre-Celtic would then have been
accepted as an equivalent. Mr. Frere speaks of the flint
implements as “evidently weapons of war fabricated and used
by a people who had not the use of metals.” He further
adds: “The manner in which they lie would lead to the
persuasion that it was a place of their manufacture, and not of
their accidental deposit; and the numbers of them were so
great that the man who carried on the brick-work told me
that before he was aware of their being objects of curiosity he
had emptied baskets full of them into the ruts of the adjoining
road.”<a id='r16'/><a href='#f16' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[16]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>When, in December 1886, Mr. J. Allan Brown communicated
to the same Society an analogous discovery near Ealing,
Middlesex, English archæologists had become so familiar with
the idea of the antiquity of palæolithic man, and the arts of
his epoch, that the existence of pre-Celtic races in Britain was
accepted as a mere truism. It was not, therefore, any matter
of surprise to be told of the discovery of a palæolithic workshop
floor of the Drift period, near Ealing. It lay about a
hundred feet above the present bed of the Thames; and here,
six feet below the surface, on an ancient sloping bank of the
river, an area of about forty feet square disclosed nearly six
hundred unabraded worked flints, including neatly finished
spear heads from five to six inches in length. Alongside of
these lay roughly wrought axes, chipped on one or both sides
to a cutting edge, and some of them unfinished. There were
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
also flint flakes, some with serrated edges, and well-finished
knives, borers, drills, chisels, etc. Waste flakes and chippings,
as well as cores, or partially worked blocks of flint, were also
observed in sufficient numbers to leave no doubt that here, in
the place of their manufacture, lay buried beneath the accumulations
of unnumbered centuries industrial products of the
skilled artizans of the British Islands contemporary with the
long-extinct quaternary fauna.<a id='r17'/><a href='#f17' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[17]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The types of flint implements, found at Hoxne in 1797,
correspond to other palæoliths recovered from rolled gravel and
clay of the glacial drift in the valleys of the Thames, the
Somme, and the Seine. In their massive and artless rudeness
they seem to realise for us some fit ideal of the primitive
fabricator in his first efforts at tool-making. But the Ealing
find accords with the more extended discoveries of this class.
In reality, the manufactures of palæolithic man, as a whole,
are less artless than many examples of modern Indian flint-work.
Not a few of the stone axes have had their shape
determined by that of the water-worn stones out of which they
were fashioned, and so required much less skill than was
necessarily expended in chipping the flint nodule into the
rudest of pointed implements. Any close-grained rock, admitting
of grinding and polish, was available for fashioning the
larger weapons and domestic implements, alike among the
men of the Neolithic age and the native races of the American
continent in modern centuries. For many of the simpler
requirements of the tool-user, any apt stone chip or water-worn
pebble sufficed; and scarcely anything can be conceived
of more rude or artless than some of the stone weapons and
implements in use among savage tribes at the present day.
Professor Joseph Leidy describes a scraper employed by the
Shoshone Indians in dressing buffalo-skins, consisting of a thin
segment of quartzite, so devoid of manipulative skill that, he
says, had he noticed it among the strata of indurated clays and
sandstone, instead of seeing it in actual use, he would have
regarded it as an accidental spawl.<a id='r18'/><a href='#f18' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[18]</span></sup></a> Dr. Charles C. Abbott, in
his <span class='it'>Primitive Industry of the Native Races</span>, furnishes illustrations
of pointed flakes, or arrow tips, triangular arrow heads, spear
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
heads, and other stone implements, only a little less rude and
shapeless.<a id='r19'/><a href='#f19' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[19]</span></sup></a> Of a similar character is the blade of a war-club
in use among the Indians of the Rio Frio, in Texas.<a id='r20'/><a href='#f20' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[20]</span></sup></a> Nothing
so rude has been ascribed to artificial origin among the disclosures
of the drift, though corresponding implements may
have escaped notice; for were it not that the chipped piece of
trachyte of the Texas war-club is inserted in a wooden haft of
unmistakable human workmanship, the blade would scarcely
suggest the idea of artificial origin. Mere rudeness, therefore,
is no certain evidence of the first artless efforts of man to
furnish himself with tools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until we arrive at the period of neolithic art, with its perforated
hammers, grooved axes, net-sinkers, gouges, adzes, and
numerous other ground and polished implements, fashioned of
granite, diorite, trap, and other igneous rocks, the forms of
implements are few and simple, dependent to a large extent
on the natural cleavage of the flint. The commoner examples
of neolithic art, recovered in thousands from ancient Scandinavian,
Gaulish, and British graves, from the lake-dwellings of
Switzerland, the Danish and British shell mounds, the peat
mosses of Denmark and Ireland, and from numerous other
depositories of prehistoric industrial art, are scarcely distinguishable
from the flint knives, scrapers, spears, and arrow
heads, or the chisels and axes, manufactured by the American
Indians at the present day. The material available in certain
localities, such as the claystone of the Haida and Babeen
Indians, and the argillite of the old implement-makers of New
Jersey, the obsidian of Mexico, or the quartz, jasper, and
greenstone of many Canadian centres, give a specific character
to the implements of the various regions; but, on the whole,
the arts of the Stone period of the most diverse races and eras
present striking analogies, scarcely less suggestive of the
operation of a tool-making instinct than the work of the
nest-builders, or the ingenious art of the beaver. But the
massive and extremely rude implements of the river-drift and
caves present essentially different types, controlled indeed, like
the productions of later artificers, by the natural cleavage and
other essential properties of the material in which the flint-worker
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
wrought, but with some characteristic differences,
suggestive of habits and conditions of life in which the
artificer of the Mammoth or Reindeer period differed from the
tool-maker of Europe’s Neolithic age, or the Indian savage of
modern centuries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tool-bearing drift-gravel of France and England presents
its relics of primitive art intermingled with countless
amorphous unwrought flints. Both have been subjected to
the violent action of floods, to which the present condition of
such geological deposits is due; and many contents of the
caves, though subjected to less violence, are the results of
similar causes. But, along with numerous implements of the
rude drift type, the sheltered recesses of the caves have preserved,
not only the smaller and more delicate flint implements,
but carefully wrought tools and weapons of bone, horn,
and ivory. Some, at least, of those undoubtedly belong to the
Palæolithic age, and therefore tend to verify conclusions, not
only as to the mechanical ingenuity, but also as to the
intellectual capacity of the earliest tool-makers. The large
almond and tongue-shaped flint implements are so massive as
to have effectually resisted the violence to which they, along
with other contents of the rolled gravels in which they occur,
were subjected; whereas it is only in the favouring shelter of
the caves, or in rare primitive sepulchral deposits, that delicate
trimmed flakes and the more perishable implements of bone
and ivory, or horn, have escaped destruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The palæolithic implements to which Boucher de Perthes
directed attention so early as 1840, were recovered from drift-gravel
beds, where amorphous flint nodules, both whole and
fractured, abound in countless numbers; and this tended to
suggest very reasonable doubts as to the artificial origin of the
rude implements lying in close proximity to them. Nor was
this incredulity lessened by the significance assigned by him
to other contents of the same drift-gravel. For so far was
Boucher de Perthes from overlooking the endless variety of
fractured pieces of flint recoverable from the drift beds, that
his narrative is supplemented by a series of plates of
<span class='it'>L’Industrie Primitive</span>, the larger number of which present
chipped flints so obviously the mere products of accidental
fracture or of weathering, that they contributed in no slight
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
degree to discredit the book on its first appearance. Others
of them, however, show true flakes, scrapers, and fragments
probably referable to smaller implements of the same class,
such as would be recognised without hesitation as of
artificial origin if found alongside of undoubted flint implements
in a cave deposit, or in any barrow, cist, or sepulchral
urn. In so far as they belong to the true Drift, and not to
the Neolithic or the Gallo-Roman period, they tend to confirm
the idea that the large almond and tongue-shaped implements
are not the sole relics of palæolithic art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now that adequate attention has been given to the
stone implements of the Drift-folk, or the men of the Mammoth
and Reindeer ages, it becomes apparent that they are by
no means limited to such localities. On the contrary, sites of
native manufactories of flint implements, with abundant
remains of the fractured debris of the ancient tool-makers’
workshop, some of which are described on a later page, have
been discovered remote from any locality where the raw
material could be procured. Until the gun flint was superseded
by the percussion cap, the material for its manufacture
was procured by sinking shafts through the chalk until the
beds of flint suited for the purpose were reached. In this the
modern flint-worker only repeated the practice of the primitive
tool-maker. A group of ancient flint pits at Cissbury, near
Worthing, has been brought into prominent notice by the
systematic explorations of Colonel A. Lane Fox. They occur
in and around one of the aboriginal hill-forts of Sussex, the
name of which has been connected with Cissa, the son of
Ella, who is referred to by Camden as “Saxon king of those
parts.” But any occupation of the old hill-fort as a Saxon
stronghold belongs to very recent times when compared with
that of the flint-workers, whose pits have attracted the notice
of modern explorers. Colonel Lane Fox describes Cissbury
Hill Fort as a great flint arsenal. Here within its earthen
ramparts the workmen who fashioned the arms of the Stone
age excavated for the beds of native flint in the underlying
chalk, and industriously worked it into every variety of
weapon. “In one place a collection of large flakes might be
seen, where evidently the first rough outline of a flint implement
had been formed. In another place a quantity of small
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
flakes showed where a celt had been brought to perfection by
minute and careful chipping.”<a id='r21'/><a href='#f21' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[21]</span></sup></a> In other excavations the
pounders, or stone hammers, were found, with a smooth
rounded end by which they were held in the hand, and the
other bruised and fractured in the manufacture of the flint
implements that abound on the same site.<a id='r22'/><a href='#f22' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[22]</span></sup></a> Twenty-five pits
were explored; and from these hundreds of worked flints were
recovered in every stage of workmanship: chips, flakes, cores,
balls, and finished knives; drills, scrapers, spear heads, and
axes or celts. In fact, Colonel Lane Fox sums up his general
statement of details with the remark that “Cissbury has produced
specimens of nearly every type known to have been
found among flint implements, from the Drift and Cave up to
the Surface period.”<a id='r23'/><a href='#f23' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[23]</span></sup></a> But this “Woolwich” of the flint age
occupied an altogether exceptional position, with the raw
material immediately underlying the military enclosure, not
improbably constructed on purpose to defend the primitive
arsenal and workshop, and so render its garrison independent
of all foreign supplies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other flint pits point to the labours of the industrious
miner, and the probable transport of the raw material to
distant localities where the prized flint could only be procured
from traders, who bartered it for other needful supplies. An
interesting group of flint pits of this latter class has been
subjected to careful exploration by the Rev. Canon Greenwell,
with the ingenious inference already noted, of the traces of a
left-handed workman among the flint-miners of the Neolithic
age. This was based on the relative position and markings of
two picks fashioned from the antlers of the red deer, corresponding
to others of the ancient miners’ tools found scattered
through the long-deserted shafts and galleries of the flint pits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shallow depressions on the surface, which guide the
explorer to those shafts of the ancient workmen, are analogous
to others that reveal the funnel-shaped excavations hereafter
described, on Flint Ridge, the sites of ancient flint pits of the
American arrow-makers. In France, Germany, and Switzerland,
as well as in Great Britain, many localities are no less familiar,
on which the refuse flakes, and chippings of flint and other
available material, show where they have been systematically
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
fashioned into implements. The Museum of the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland has acquired numerous interesting
additions to its collections of objects of this class by encouraging
systematic research. From the sands at Colvin and
Findhorn, Morayshire; Little Ferry, Sutherlandshire; and
from Burghhead, Drainie, and Culbin sands, Elginshire, nearly
seven thousand specimens have been recovered, consisting
chiefly of flint flakes and chippings; but also including
several hundred arrow heads, knives, and scrapers, many of
them unfinished or broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, in various localities, remote from native sources of
flint, a systematic manufacture of implements appears to have
been carried on. There can, therefore, be scarcely any hesitation
in inferring, from the evidence adduced, first a trade in
the raw material brought from the distant localities of the
flint mines; and then a local traffic in the manufactured
implements, as was undoubtedly the case among the American
aborigines at no remote date. This aspect of primitive interchange,
both of the raw material and the products of industrial
skill, in so far as it is illustrated in the practice of the
American Indian tribes, merits the most careful study, as a
help to the interpretation of the archæological evidence
pertaining to prehistoric times. To the superficial observer,
stone is of universal occurrence; and it seems, therefore, needless
to inquire where the implement-maker of any Stone age
procured the rough block out of which he fashioned his
weapon or tool. Only when copper, bronze, and iron superseded
the crude material of the Stone age has it been supposed
to be needful to determine the sources of supply. But that is a
hasty and wholly incorrect surmise. The untutored savage is
indeed greatly limited in his choice of materials. We are
familiar with the shell-workers of the Caribbees and the
Pacific Islands, and the horn and ivory workers of Arctic
regions; but where the resources of an ample range could be
turned to account, the primitive workman learned at a very
early date to select by preference such stones as break with a
conchoidal fracture. Only where such could not be had, the
most available chance-fractured chip or the apt water-worn
stone was turned to account. Rude implements are accordingly
met with fashioned of trap, sienite, diorite, granite, and other
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
igneous rocks, as well as from quartzite, agate, jasper,
serpentine, and slate. Some of those materials were specially
favoured by the neolithic workmen for certain classes of their
carefully finished weapons and implements, such as perforated
hammers, large axes, gouges, and chisels. But the natural
cleavage of the flint, and the sharp edge exposed by every
fracture, adapt it for fashioning the smaller knives, lance and
arrow heads, in a way no other material except obsidian
equals. Hence flint appears to have been no less in request
among ancient tool-makers than copper, tin, and iron in the
later periods of metallurgic art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact that tin is a metal of rare occurrence, though
found in nearly inexhaustible quantities in some regions, has
given a peculiar significance to certain historical researches,
apart from the special interest involved in the processes of the
primitive metallurgist, and the widely diffused traces of
workers in bronze. The comparative rarity of flint, and its
total absence in many localities, suggest a like inquiry into
the probable sources of its supply in regions remote from its
native deposits. The flint lance or arrow head, thrown by an
enemy, or wrested from the grasp of a vanquished foe, would,
as in the case of improved weapons of war in many a later
age, first introduce the prized material to the notice of less
favoured tribes. As the primitive tool-maker learned by
experience the greater adaptability of flint than of most other
stones for the manufacture of his weapons and implements, it
may be assumed that it became an object of barter in localities
remote from those where it abounds; and thus, by its diffusion,
it may have constituted a recognised form of <span class='it'>pecunia</span> ages
before the barter of pastoral tribes gave rise to the peculiar
significance attached to that term.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One piece of confirmatory evidence of trade in unwrought
flint is the frequent occurrence of numerous flint flakes among
the prized gifts deposited with the dead. Canon Greenwell
describes, among the contents of a Yorkshire barrow in the
parish of Ganton, a deposit of flint flakes and chippings
numbering one hundred and eighteen, along with a few
finished scrapers and arrow heads;<a id='r24'/><a href='#f24' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[24]</span></sup></a> and smaller deposits of
like kind are repeatedly noted by him. Still more, he describes
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
their occurrence under circumstances which suggest the
probability of the scattering of flint flakes, like an offering of
current coin, by the mourners, as the primitive grave was
covered in and the memorial mound piled over the sacred
spot. Flints and potsherds, he says, occur more constantly,
and even more abundantly than bones; and this presents to
his mind a difficult problem, in considering which he refers to
an analogous practice of a very diverse age. The maimed
rites at poor Ophelia’s grave are familiar to the reader of
<span class='it'>Hamlet</span>. The priest replies to the demand of Laertes for more
ample ceremony at his sister’s burial:—</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But that great command o’ersways the order,</p>
<p class='line0'>She should in ground unsanctified have lodged</p>
<p class='line0'>Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,</p>
<p class='line0'>Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The flints and potsherds, Canon Green well remarks, “occur
at times in very large quantities, the flints generally in the
shape of mere chippings and waste pieces, but often as
manufactured articles, such as arrow points, knives, saws, drills
and scrapers, etc.” He further notes that they are found
distributed throughout the sepulchral mound, “in some
instances in such quantities as to suggest the idea that the
persons who were engaged in throwing up the barrow, scattered
them from time to time during the process.” Assuredly whatever
motive actuated those who contributed such objects while
the sepulchral mound was in progress of erection, they were
not designed as any slight to the manes of the dead. In
districts remote from those where the flint abounds, flakes and
chips of the prized material must have been in constant demand
to replenish the sheaf of arrows, and replace the lost or broken
lance, knife, and scraper. The trader would barter the raw
material for furs and other equivalents, or the industrious
miner would carry off an adequate supply for his own future
use. Such small objects, possessing a universally appreciable
value, would be as available for current change as the African
cowrie, the Ioqua shells of the Pacific coast, or the wampum-beads
of the tribes to the east of the Rocky Mountains. If
this assumption be correct, the scattering of flint flakes, while
the mound was being piled over the grave, was a form of
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
largess not less significant than any later tribute of reverence
to the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sources whence such supplies of raw material of the old
flint-worker were derived, have been sufficiently explored to
furnish confirmatory evidence of some, at least, of the deductions
suggested by other indications thus far noted. The
archæologists of Europe are now familiar with many localities
which have been the quarries and workshops, as well as the
settled abodes, of palæolithic and neolithic man; nor are such
unknown in America, though research has to be greatly extended
before definite conclusions can be accepted relative to
the earliest presence of man on the western continent. Flint
and stone implements of every variety of form, and nearly
every degree of rudeness, abound in the soil of the New World.
But in estimating the true significance of such evidence, it has
to be borne in remembrance that its indigenous population
has not even now abandoned the arts of their Stone period.
Implements have already been referred to still in use among
the Shoshone, Texas, and other living tribes, ruder than any
yet recovered from the river-drift of France or England; whilst
others, more nearly resembling the palæolithic types of Europe,
have been met with, some of them imbedded in the rolled gravels,
or glacial drift, and associated with bones of the mastodon
and other fossil mammals. But the evidence as to palæolithic
origin has been, at best, doubtful. An imperfect flint knife,
now in the Museum of the University of Toronto, was recovered
from a depth of upwards of fourteen feet, among rolled gravel
and gold-bearing quartz of the Grinnel Leads in Kansas Territory.
Flint implements from the auriferous gravel of California
were produced at the Paris Exposition of 1855. According
to the Geological Survey of Illinois for 1866, stone axes and
flint spear heads were obtained from a bed of local drift near
Alton, underlying the loess, and at the same depth as bones of
the mastodon. Similar discoveries have been repeatedly noted
in Southern States. The river Chattahoochee, in Georgia, in
its course down the Nacoochee valley, flows through a rich
auriferous region. Explorers in search for gold have made
extensive cuttings through the underlying drift-gravel, down to
the slate rock upon which it rests; and during one of these
excavations, at a depth of nine feet, intermingled with the
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
gravel and boulders of the drift, three large implements were
found, nearly resembling the rude flint hatchets of the drift
type. Examples of this class, however, though repeatedly noted,
have been too isolated to admit of their use for any such
comprehensive inductions as the disclosures of the glacial drift
of north-western Europe have justified. The evidence hitherto
adduced, when implements of this class have been of flint, has
failed to establish their palæolithic age, notwithstanding their
recovery from ancient gravels. Implements of flint occur in
great abundance throughout vast areas of the American continent.
With the fact before us that even now the Stone
period of its aborigines has not wholly passed away, careful
observation is required in determining the probable age of
stray specimens buried even at considerable depths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But disclosures of an actual American implement-bearing
drift appear at length to have been met with in the valley of
the Delaware. These show the primitive tool-maker resorting
to a granular argillite, the cleavage of which adapted itself to
the requirements of his rude art. Professor Shaler, in a report on
the age of the Delaware gravel beds, describes this formation
as occurring from Virginia northward to Labrador, though it is
only in New Jersey and Delaware that the accompanying
evidences of human art have been thus far recovered. The
New Jersey drift is made up of transported material, including
boulders and smaller fragments of granitic, hypogene, sandstone,
and limestone rocks, along with water-worn pebbles of the
same granular argillite as the characteristic stone implements
recovered from it, to which, from their peculiar shape, the name
of “turtle-back celts” has been given. There is little true
clay in the deposit to give coherence to the mass. The type
of pebble is subovate, or discoidal, suggesting its form to be
due to the action of running water; and it seems probable that
the stone was not quarried out of the living rock, but that the
pebbles thus reduced to a convenient form were turned to
account by the tool-maker. The researches of Dr. Abbott
have been rewarded by the discovery in the drift-gravel of
numerous examples of this peculiar type of implement, for
which the one material appears to have been used, notwithstanding
the varied contents of the drift-gravel in which they
occur. As in the case of the French and English river-drift,
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
the fractured material is found in every stage of disintegration.
Professor Shaler says: “Along with the perfect-looking implements
figured by Dr. Abbott, which are apparently as clearly artificial
as the well-known remains of the valley of the Somme, there
are all grades of imperfect fragments, down to the pebbles that
are without a trace of chipping.” But more recent discoveries
in the Delaware valley point to remains of a still earlier age
than those described by Dr. Abbott. These naturally attracted
attention to the region; for there, for the first time, the
American archæologist saw a promise of disclosures corresponding
in character to those of the European drift-gravels. A
systematic and prolonged series of investigations accordingly
carried out by Mr. Hilborne T. Cresson, under the direction of
the Peabody Museum, have resulted in fresh disclosures of early
American man. The Naaman’s Creek rock-shelter, carefully
explored by him, is situated in the State of Delaware, immediately
to the south of Mason and Dixon’s line. There in
underlying deposits, claimed to be of Post-Glacial age, rudely
chipped points and other implements, all of argillite, were
found; and at a higher level, others of argillite, but intermingled
with bone implements, and fragments of rude pottery,
and alongside of these, implements fashioned of quartzite and
jasper. The antiquity assigned to the Delaware implements,
as determined by the age of the tool-bearing gravel, is much
greater than that of the Trenton gravels previously referred to;
but though remains of fifteen different species of animals,
including fragments of a human skull, were recovered from the
cave or rock-shelter, they include none but existing fauna.
But the evidence of antiquity is based most confidently on the
discovery of palæoliths <span class='it'>in situ</span> in the true Philadelphia red
gravel. Professor G. F. Wright remarks, in discussing the relative
ages of the Trenton and Philadelphia red gravel, that both
he and Professor Lewis came to the same conclusion: assigning
the deposition of the red gravel to a period when the ice
had its greatest extension, and when there was considerable
local depression of the land. “During this period of greatest
ice-extension and depression, the Philadelphia Red Gravel and
Brick Clay were deposited by the ice-laden floods which
annually poured down the valley in the summer season. As
the ice retreated towards the headwaters of the valley, the
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
period was marked also by a re-elevation of the land to about
its present height, when the later deposits of gravel at Trenton
took place. Dr. Abbott’s discoveries at Trenton prove the
presence of man on the continent at that stage of the Glacial
epoch. Mr. Cresson’s discoveries prove the presence of man at
a far earlier stage. How much earlier will depend upon our
interpretation of the general facts bearing on the question of
the duality of the Glacial epoch,”<a id='r25'/><a href='#f25' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[25]</span></sup></a>—a branch of the inquiry
which it is not necessary to discuss here. It is sufficient to
note that this argillite—an altogether inferior material to the
flint, or hornstone of later tool-makers,—appears, thus far, to be
a characteristic feature of American palæolithic art. The
locality of the native rock is still undetermined; but implements
fashioned of it have been found in great numbers along
the escarpments facing the river Delaware. Professor Shaler
describes the material as a curious granular argillite, the like
of which, he says, “I do not know in place.” Should the native
rock be hereafter identified, with traces of the manufactured
celts in its vicinity, it may help to throw light on the age and
history of the primitive American implement-makers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flint of the cretaceous deposits does not occur in
America. True chalk is all but unknown among the cretaceous
strata of the continent, although it has been found in the form
of a somewhat extensive bed in Western Kansas. In Texas,
the cretaceous limestones contain in places hornstone nodules
distributed through them, like the flint nodules in the upper
chalk beds of Europe. But though, so far, differing in origin,
the hornstone and flint are practically identical; and the chert,
or hornstone, which abounds in the chert-layers of the corniferous
formation, of common occurrence in Canada, is simply a
variety of flint, consisting essentially, like the substance to
which that name is specifically applied, of amorphous silica,
and with a similar cleavage. This Devonian formation is made
up chiefly of limestone strata, parted in many places by layers
of chert which vary in thickness from half an inch to three or
four inches. The limestones are more or less bituminous, and
frequently contain chert nodules. Most of their fossils are
silicified. The formation underlies a considerable portion of
South-western Ontario. Out-crops occur at Port Dover, Port
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
Colborne, Kincardine, Woodstock, St. Mary’s, and other
localities. At a point which I have explored more than once
near Port Dover, implements occur in considerable numbers,
along with fractured or imperfect specimens, mingled with
flakes and chippings, evidently indicative of a spot where their
manufacture was carried on. At this, and some others of the
localities here named, Canadian flint pits may be looked for.
Among other objects illustrative of primitive native arts in the
Museum of the University of Toronto, is a block of flint or
brown chert, from which flakes have been struck off for the
use of the native arrow-maker. This flint core was found in a
field on Paisley Block, in Guelph Township, along with a
large flake, a scraper, and fourteen arrow heads of various
sizes, all made from the same material. Alongside of them
lay a flint hammer-stone bearing marks of long use. All of
those objects are now in the University Museum, and appear to
indicate the site of an aboriginal workshop, with one of the
tools of the ancient arrow-maker, who there fashioned his
implements and weapons, and traded with them to supply the
need of the old Huron or Petun Indians of Western Canada.
The Spider Islands in Lake Winnipeg, near its outlet, have
been noted by Dr. Robert Bell, as a favourite resort of the old
workers in flint, where they could trade the products of their
industry with parties of Indians passing in their canoes. “I
have found,” he says, “a considerable number of new flint
implements, all of one pattern, in a grave near one of those
sites of an old factory”; the body of a man—presumably the
old arrow-maker,—had been buried there in a sitting posture,
surrounded with the latest products of his industrious skill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1875 I devoted several weeks to a careful study of
some of the principal groups of ancient earthworks in the
Ohio valley, and visited Flint Ridge to examine a group of native
flint pits in the old Shawnee territory. The Shawnees were
formerly a numerous and powerful tribe of Indians; but they
took part, in 1763, in the conspiracy of Pontiac, and were nearly
exterminated in a battle fought in the vicinity of their old
quarries. From these it is probable that the older race of Mound-Builders
of the Ohio valley procured the material from which
they manufactured many of their implements, including some
of those used in the construction of their great earthworks.
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Flint Ridge, as the locality is called, a siliceous deposit of
the Carboniferous age, extends through the State of Ohio, from
Newark to New Lexington. It has been worked at various
points in search of the prized material; and the ancient pits
can still be recognised over an extensive area by the funnel-shaped
hollows, or slighter depressions where the accumulated
vegetable mould of many winters has nearly effaced the traces
of the old miners. The chert, or hornstone, of this locality
accords with that from which the implements recovered from
the mounds appear to have been chiefly made. One fact
which such disclosures place beyond doubt, namely, that the
so-called Mound-Builders had not advanced beyond the stage
of flint or stone implements, is of great significance. Their
numbers are proved by the extent of their earthworks in many
localities in the Ohio valley; and the consequent supply of
implements needed by them as builders must have involved
a constant demand for the flint-miners and tool-makers. The
great earthworks at Newark are among the most extensive
structures of this class, covering an area of several miles, and
characterised by the perplexing element of elaborate geometrical
figures, executed on a gigantic scale by a people still in the primitive
stage of stone implements, and yet giving proof of skill fully
equalling, in the execution of their geometrical designs, that of
the scientific land-surveyor. On this special aspect of the
question, it may be well to revert to notes written immediately
after a careful survey of the Newark earthworks, so as to suggest
more clearly their extent and the consequent number of workmen
and of tools in demand for their execution. The sacred
enclosures have to be classed apart from the military works of
the Mound-Builders. Their elaborate fortifications occupy
isolated heights specially adapted for defence, whereas the broad
river-terraces have been selected for their religious works.
There, on the great unbroken levels, they form groups of symmetrical
enclosures, square, circular, elliptical, and octagonal, connected
by long parallel avenues, suggesting analogies with the
British Avebury, the Breton Carnac, or even with the temples
and sphinx-avenues of the Egyptian Karnak and Luxor; but all
wrought of earth, with the simple tools made from quartzite,
chert, or hornstone, derived from quarries and flint pits, such as
those of Flint Ridge, the localities of which have been identified.
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>For a time the tendency among American archæologists
was to exaggerate the antiquity of those works, and to overestimate
the artistic skill of their builders. But it now
appears that some vague memories of the race have been
perpetuated. The traditions of the Delawares preserved the
remembrance of the Talligew or Tallegewi, a powerful nation
whose western borders extended to the Mississippi, over whom
they, in conjunction with the fierce warrior race of Wyandots
or Iroquois, triumphed. The old name of the Mound-Builders
is believed to survive, in modified form, in that of the Alleghany
Mountains and River; and the Chatta-Muskogee tribes,
including the Choctaws, Chickasaws, Creeks, and other southern
Indians of the same stock, are supposed to represent the
ancient race. The broad fertile region stretching southward
from the Appalachian Mountains to the Gulf of Mexico must
have attracted settlers from earliest times. It was latterly
occupied by various tribes of this Chatta-Muskogee stock; but
intermingled with others speaking essentially different languages,
and supposed to be the descendants of the older occupants
of the region on whom the Tallegewi intruded when
driven out of the Ohio valley. The Cherokees preserved a
tradition of having come from the upper Ohio. They have
been classed by the Washington ethnologists as a distant
branch of the Iroquois stock; but Mr. Hale, finding their
grammar mainly Huron-Iroquois, while their vocabulary is
largely derived from another source, ingeniously infers that one
portion of the despairing Talligewi may have cast in their lot
with the conquering race, as the Tlascalans did with the
Spaniards in their war against the Aztecs. Driven down the
Mississippi till they reached the country of the Choctaws,
they, mingling with friendly tribes, became the founders of
the Cherokee nation. Among the older native tribes were the
Catawbas and the Natchez. They were sun-worshippers,
maintained a perpetual fire, and regarded the great luminary
as a goddess, and the mother of their race. It is probable that
in their religious rites some memory survived of the more
elaborate worship of the old occupants of the Ohio valley; for the
Natchez claimed that in their prosperity they numbered five
hundred towns, and their northern borders extended to the Ohio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Soto traversed the Chatta-Muskogee region, when, in
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
1540, he discovered the Mississippi. He found there a
numerous population lodged in well-constructed dwellings, and
with their council-houses surmounting lofty mounds. De
Soto and later travellers noted their extensive fields of maize,
beans, squashes, and tobacco, and their well-finished flint
implements. They were Mound-Builders; and though no
longer manifesting in extended geometrical earthworks the
special characteristic of the old race, it is assumed that in
them we recover traces of the vanished people of the Ohio
valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this assignment of the Mound-Builders to an affinity
with Indian nations still represented by existing tribes, the vague
idea of some strange prehistoric American race of remote
antiquity vanishes; and the latter tendency has been rather to
underestimate their distinctive peculiarities. Some of these
seem to separate them from any Indian tribe of which definite
accounts have been preserved; and foremost among them is
the evidence of comprehensive design, and of scientific skill in
the construction of their sacred enclosures. The predominant
impression suggested by the great military earthworks of the
Mound-Builders is that of a people co-operating under the
guidance of approved leaders, with a view to the defence of
large communities. Elaborate fortifications are erected on well-chosen
hills or bluffs, and strengthened by ditches, mounds, and
complicated approaches; but the lines of earthwork are everywhere
adapted to the natural features of the site. The sacred
enclosures are, on the contrary, constructed on the level river-terraces
with elaborate artificiality of design, but on a scale of
magnitude not less imposing than that of the largest hill-forts.
On first entering the great circle at Newark, and looking across
its broad trench at the lofty embankment overshadowed with
tall forest trees, my thoughts reverted to the Antonine vallum,
which by like evidence still records the presence of the Roman
masters of the world in North Britain 1700 years ago.
But after driving over a circuit of several miles, embracing
the remarkable earthworks of which that is only a single
feature, and satisfying myself by personal observation of the
existence of parallel avenues which have been traced for nearly
two miles and of the grand oval, circles, and octagon, the
smallest of which measures upwards of half a mile in circumference,
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
all idea of mere combined labour is lost in the higher
conviction of manifest skill, and even science. The octagon
indeed is not a perfect figure. Its angles are not coincident,
but the sides are very nearly equal; and the enclosure
approaches so closely to an accurate figure that its error is only
demonstrated by actual survey. Connected with it by parallel
embankments 350 feet long, is a true circle, measuring
2880 feet in circumference; and distant nearly a mile from
this, but connected with it by an elaborate series of earthworks,
is the great circular structure previously referred to. Its actual
form is an ellipse; the different diameters of which are 1250
feet and 1150 feet respectively; and it encloses an area
of upwards of 30 acres. At the entrance the enclosing
embankment curves outward on either side for a distance of
100 feet, leaving a level way between the ditches, 80 feet
wide, and at this point it measures about 30 feet from the
bottom of the ditch to the summit. The area of the enclosure
is almost perfectly level, so that during rain-floods the water
stands at a uniform height nearly to the edge of the ditch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The skulls of the Mound-Builders have been appealed to for
indications of the intellectual capacity of the ancient race; but
mounds and earthworks were habitually resorted to at long
subsequent dates as favourite places of interment; so that
skulls derived from modern graves are ascribed to the ancient
race; and much difficulty has been found in agreeing on a
typical mound skull. Even after making allowance for modifications
due to artificial malformation, and eliminating those
derived from superficial interments, a very noticeable diversity
is found in the comparatively few undoubtedly genuine mound
skulls, which may lend some countenance to the idea of the
presence of two essentially distinct races among the ancient
settlers in the Ohio valley.<a id='r26'/><a href='#f26' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[26]</span></sup></a> It seems to accord with the unmistakable
traces of intellectual progress of a kind foreign to the
attainments of any known race of the North American continent,
thus found in association with arts and methods of work not
greatly in advance of those of the Indian savage. The only
satisfactory solution of the problem seems to present itself in
the assumption of the existence among them of a theocratic
order, like the priests of ancient Egypt, the Brahmins of India,
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
or the Incas of Peru, under whom the vanished race of the
Ohio valley—Tallegewi, Muskogees, Natchez, Alleghans, or
other American aborigines,—executed their vast geometrical
earthworks with such mathematical accuracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The contents of the earthworks of the Ohio and Mississippi
valleys show that the copper, found in a pure metallic condition
at various points around Lake Superior, was not unknown
to their constructors. But in this they had little advantage
over the Iroquois and Algonkin tribes, in whose grave mounds
copper axes and spear heads occasionally occur. It is even
possible that working parties were despatched from time to
time to the ancient copper mines on the Kewenaw peninsula,
on Lake Superior, to bring back supplies of the prized malleable
rock, which could be bent and hammered into shape in a way
that no other stone was susceptible of. But the labours of
the native miners were inadequate to provide supplies that
could in any degree suffice to displace the flint or quartzite of
the implement-maker. One use, however, has been suggested
for the copper, in relation to the labours of the flint-workers.
Mr. George Ercol Sellers, whose researches among the workshops
of the ancient tool-makers have thrown much light on
their processes, was led, from careful observation of some of
their unfinished work, to the opinion that copper was in
special request in the operations of the flint-flaker. After
referring to the well-known use of horn or bone-flakers, he
thus proceeds: “From the narrowness of the cuts in some of
the specimens, and the thickness of the stone where they
terminate, I have inclined to the belief that, at the period
they were made, the aborigines had something stronger than
bone to operate with, as I have never been able to imitate
some of their deep heavy cuts with it; but I have succeeded
by using a copper point, which possesses all the properties of
the bone, in holding to its work without slipping, and has the
strength for direct thrust required.”<a id='r27'/><a href='#f27' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[27]</span></sup></a> No copper tool, however,
was recovered by Mr. Sellers among the vast accumulations
of implements and waste chips, hereafter described, on the sites
of the ancient workers’ industrious operations, though some
of those found elsewhere may have been used for such a
purpose.
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence that the ancient dwellers in the Ohio valley
were still in their Stone age is indisputable. But to a people
apparently under the guidance of an order or cast far in
advance of themselves in some important branches of knowledge,
and by whom the utility of the metals was beginning
to be discerned—though they had not yet mastered the first
step in metallurgy by the use of fire,—their speedy advance
beyond the neolithic stage was inevitable. But an open
valley, accessible on all sides, was peculiarly unfavourable for
the first transitional stage of a people just emerging from
barbarism. Their numbers, it is obvious, were considerable;
and agriculture must have been carried out on a large scale to
furnish the means of subsistence for a settled community.
They had entered on a course which, if unimpeded, must have
inevitably tended to develop the higher elements of social life
and political organisation. But their duration as a settled
community appears to have been brief. Some faint tradition
of the irruption of the northern barbarians of the New World
survives. The Iroquois, that indomitable race of savage
warriors, swept through the valley with desolating fury; the
dawn of civilisation on the northern continent of America
was abruptly arrested; and the present name of the great
river along the banks and on the tributaries of which the
memorials of the Tallegewi abound, is one conferred on it by
their supplanters, who were equally successful in thwarting the
aims of France to introduce the higher forms of European
civilisation there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some singularly interesting information relative to the
traces of the ancient flint-workers in the Ohio valley, is
furnished by Mr. Sellers. His observations were made when
that region still remained, to a large extent, undisturbed by
civilised intruders on the deserted Indian settlements. He
notes many places along the banks of the Ohio and its
tributaries, at an elevation above the spring floods except at
rare intervals of violent freshets, where the flaking process of
the old flint-workers had been extensively carried on, and
where cores and waste chips abound. “At one of those
places, on the Kentucky side of the river,” he says, “I found
a number of chert blocks, as when first brought from the
quarry, from which no regular flakes had been split; some
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
had a single corner broken off as a starting-point. On the
sharp right-angled edge of several I found the indentations
left by small flakes having been knocked off, evidently by
blows, as a preparation for seating the flaking tool. Most of
the localities referred to are now under cultivation. Before being
cleared of the timber and subjected to the plough, no surface
relics were found, but on the caving and wearing away of the
river banks, many spear and arrow heads and other stone
relics were left on the shore. After the land had been cleared,
and the plough had loosened the soil, one of the great floods
that occur at intervals of some fifteen or twenty years, would
wash away the loose soil, leaving the great flint workshops
exposed.” There, accordingly, he notes among the materials
thus brought to light, the cores or nuclei thrown aside, caches
stored with finished and unfinished implements and flakes, the
tools and wastage, vast accumulations of splinters, etc., all
serving to illustrate the processes of the ancient flint-workers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The depth at which some accumulations occur, overlaid by
the growth of the so-called primeval forest, points to them as
contemporary with, if not in some cases older than, the earthworks
of the Mound-Builders. The extent, indeed, to which
some are overlaid by subsequent accumulations suggests a
remote era. In 1853 Mr. Sellers first visited the site of one
of those ancient work-yards, on the northern bank of the
Saline river, about three miles above its junction with the
Ohio. The region was then covered with dense forest, with
the exception of a narrow strip along the bank of the river,
which had been cleared in connection with recently opened
coal works. But at a later date, in sinking a cistern, about
200 yards from the river bank, the excavation was made
through a mass of flint chips. Subsequently heavy rains,
after ploughing, exposed some spears and arrow points. “But
it was not until the great flood of the winter of 1862 and
1863 that overflowed this ridge three or four feet with a rapid
current, that the portion under cultivation on the river bank
was denuded, exposing over six acres of what at first appeared
to be a mass of chips or stone rubbish, but amongst it were
found many hammer-stones, celts, grooved axes, cores, flakes,
almost innumerable scrapers and other implements, and many
tynes from the buck or stag, all of which bore evidence of
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
having been scraped to a point. On exposure to the air they
fell to pieces.” The actual site of the quarry appears to have
been subsequently identified. “The greater number of cores,
scattered flakes, finished and unfinished implements, are of the
chert from a depression in a ridge three miles to the south-east,
where there are abundant indications of large quantities
having been quarried.” But the same great work-yard of the
ancient Mound-Builders furnished evidence of other sources of
supply. Mr. Sellers noted the finding “a few cores of the
white chert from Missouri, and the red and yellow jasper of
Kentucky and Tennessee,” but he adds, “the flakes of these
have mostly been found in nests or small caches, many of
which have been exposed; and in every case the flakes they
contained were more or less worked on their edges; whereas
the flakes from the neighbouring chert preserved their sharp
edges as when split from the mass. These cache specimens
with their worked serrated edges would, if found singly, be
classed as saws or cutting implements. But here where found
in mass, evidently brought from a distance, to a place where
harder chert of a much better character for cutting implements
abounds, they tell a different story.” The material was better
adapted for the manufacture of certain classes of small implements
much in demand, and the serrated edge is simply the
natural result of the mode of working of this species of chert
and of the jasper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fine-grained quartzite was also in request, especially
for the manufacture of the largest class of implements, including
hoes and spades, equally needed by the primitive
agriculturist, and by the navvies to whose industrious toil
the vast earthworks of the Ohio valley are due. The site of
the old quartzite quarry appears to be about eight miles from
the banks of Saline river; but there are many other localities
scattered over the region extending from southern Illinois to
the Mississippi, where the same substitute for chert or hornstone
occurs. Some of the quartzite hoes or spades measure sixteen
inches in length, with a breadth of from six to seven inches,
and evince remarkable dexterity and skill in their manufacture.
Here, accordingly, it becomes apparent that there was a time
in the history of this continent, before its existence was
revealed to the race that now peoples the Ohio valley, when
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
that region was the scene of busy native industry; and its
manufacturers quarried and wrought the chert, jasper, and
quartzite, and traded the products of their skill over an
extensive region. But the germs of an incipient native
civilisation were trodden out by the inroads of savage warriors
from the north; and the towns and villages of the industrious
community were replaced by what appeared to La Salle, the
discoverer and first explorer of Ohio river, as the primeval
forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It throws an interesting light on the industrial processes
of the ancient flint-workers to learn that, even in a region
where the useful chert abounded, they went far afield in
search of other materials specially adapted for some classes of
implements. They were unquestionably a settled community,
in a higher stage than any of the tribes found in occupation
of that or any neighbouring region when first visited by
Europeans. But many tribes, both of the Northern and
Southern States, habitually travelled far distances to the sea
coast, where still the ancient shell mounds attest their presence.
The routes thus annually pursued by the Indians of
the interior of Pennsylvania, for example, were familiar to the
early surveyors, and some of their trails undoubtedly marked
the footprints of many generations. In traversing those
routes, as well as in their autumnal encampments on the
coast, opportunities were afforded of selecting suitable materials
for their implements from localities remote from their homes.
The lines of those old trails have accordingly yielded numerous
examples of the wayfarers’ weapons and tools, as well as
of unfinished implements. We are apt to think of a people
in their Stone period as merely turning to account materials
lying as accessible to all as the loose stones employed as
missiles by the vagrant schoolboy. But such an idea is
manifestly inapplicable, not only to the arts of communities
like those by whom the earthworks of the Ohio valley were
constructed, but to many far older workers in flint or stone.
The Indian arrow-maker and the pipe-maker, it is manifest,
often travelled great distances for the material best suited to
their manufactures; and the use of flint or hornstone for
slingstones, lance and arrow heads, as well as for knives,
scrapers, axes, and other domestic and agricultural tools, must
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
have involved a constant demand for fresh supplies. It might
be assumed, therefore, apart from all direct evidence, that a
regular system of quarrying for the raw material both of the pipe
and the implement-maker was pursued; and that by trade or
barter the pipestone of divers qualities, and the chert or hornstone,
the quartzite, jasper, and other useful minerals, were thus
furnished to tribes whose homesteads and hunting-grounds
yielded no such needful supplies. But the same region which
abounds in such remarkable evidences of the ingenious arts of
a vanished race, also furnishes traces of the old miners, by
whose industry the flint was quarried and roughly chipped
into available forms for transport to distant localities, or for
barter among the Mound-Builders in the region traversed by
the great river. At various points on Flint Ridge, Ohio,
and localities far beyond the limits of that state, as at
Leavenworth, 300 miles south of Cincinnati, where the gray
flint abounds, evidences of systematic quarrying illustrate the
character and extent of this primitive commerce. Funnel-shaped
pits occur, in many cases filled up with the accumulated
vegetable mould of centuries, or only traceable by a
slight depression in the surface of the ground. When cleared
out, they extend to a depth of from four or five, to nearly
twenty feet. On removing the mould, the sloping sides of
the pit are found to be covered with pieces of fractured flint,
intermingled with unfinished or broken implements, and with
others partially reduced to shape. The largest hoes and
spades hitherto noted appear to have been fashioned of quartzite,
but those of most common occurrence in Ohio and Kentucky
are made of the gray flint or chert, which abounds in
the Flint Ridge pits in blocks amply sufficing for the manufacture
of tools upwards of a foot in length, such as may be
assumed to have been employed in the construction of the
great earthworks. But the transportation of the unwrought
blocks of hornstone to the work-yards in the valley would have
involved great labour in the construction of roads, as well as
of sledges or waggons suited to such traffic. In lieu of this,
the accumulated waste chips in the quarries show the amount
of labour that was expended there in order to facilitate the
transport of the useful material. Suitable flakes and chips were
no doubt also carried off to be turned to account for scrapers,
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
knives, and other small implements. Partially shaped disks
and other pieces of all sizes abound in the pits, but the finer
manipulation, by means of which small arrow heads, lances,
drills, scrapers, etc., were fashioned, was reserved for leisure
hours at home, and for the patient labour of the skilled tool-maker,
for whose use the raw material was chiefly quarried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the tool-bearing drift of France and England the large
characteristic flint implements occur in beds of gravel and clay
abounding in flakes and chips in every stage of accidental
fracture, to some of which M. Boucher de Perthes assigned an
artificial origin and very fanciful significance. But if the
palæolithic flint-worker in any case quarried for his material
before the latest geological reconstruction of the beds of rolled
gravel, the fractured flints may include traces of primeval
quarrying as well as of the tool-maker’s labours; for the
rolled gravel beds occur in river-valleys best adapted to the
habitat of post-glacial man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a report furnished to the Peabody Museum of Archæology,
by Mr. Paul Schumacher, he contributes some interesting
evidence relative to the stone-workers of Southern California.
The Indians of the Pacific coast, south of San Francisco, not
only furnished themselves with chisels, axes, and the like class
of implements, but with pots for culinary purposes, made of
steatite, usually of a greenish-gray colour. In 1876, Mr.
Schumacher discovered various quarries of the old pot-manufacturers,
with their tools and unfinished articles lying there.
The softer stone had been used for pots, while the close-grained
darker serpentine was chiefly employed in making the weights
for digging sticks, cups, pipes, and ornaments. “I was
struck,” he says, “on examining the locality through a field-glass,
by the discovery of so many silver-hued mounds, the
debris of pits, the rock quarries and open-air workshops, so
that I believed I had found the main factory of the ollas
of the California aborigines.”<a id='r28'/><a href='#f28' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[28]</span></sup></a> He also discovered the slate
quarry, where the rock had been broken off in irregular
blocks, from which pieces best adapted for chisels were selected
and fashioned into the forms specially useful in making the
steatite pots. A venerable Spanish lady told Mr. Schumacher
that she recollected her mother telling her how the Indians
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
had brought <span class='it'>ollas</span> in canoe-loads from the islands in Santa
Barbara Channel to the mainland, and there exchanged them
for such necessities as the islanders were in need of. This
tradition was subsequently confirmed by an old Mexican
guide. Similar evidence of systematic industry with the
accompanying trade, or barter, meets the explorer at many
points from the Gulf of Mexico northward to beyond the
Canadian lakes. The pyrulæ from the Mexican Gulf are of
frequent occurrence in northern ossuaries and grave mounds,
while corresponding southern sepulchral deposits disclose the
catlinite of the Couteau des Prairies and the native copper of
the Lake Superior mines. Obsidian is another prized material
only to be found <span class='it'>in situ</span> in volcanic regions, but met with in
manufactured forms in many diverse regions, remote from the
obsidian quarries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The routes of ancient traffic, determined in part by the
geographical contour of the regions through which they pass,
are familiar to the historical students in the Old World. The
ancient lines traversed by the traders between the Persian
Gulf and the Levant; the routes of caravans by way of the
oases, across the centre of the Arabian peninsula to the Red
Sea; the lines of access by road and river from the Baltic to
the Danube; and from the British Isles and the North Sea,
by the valley of the Rhone, to the Mediterranean: are all indicated
by a variety of evidence. The geography of Central
Africa appears to have been familiar to the Arabian traders
from remote ages. Similar well-trodden routes, and traverses
by lake and river, are well known to the investigators of
American antiquity. The great trail across Pennsylvania to
the Mississippi; the route by the great lakes and by portage
to the Hudson valley, and so to the Atlantic; from Lake
Ontario, by the Humber and Lake Simcoe, to the Georgian
Bay; from Lake Superior, by the Mitchipicotten river, to the
Hudson Bay; and by the Mississippi and its tributaries to the
Gulf of Mexico: are all demonstrated by abundant traces of
the interchange of the products of widely severed regions, as
disclosed in ancient burial mounds, and deposits assignable to
remote periods and to long-extinct races. West of the Rocky
Mountains the trails from the Pacific coast to the interior,
and through the passes of that lofty range, have been recovered.
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
Owing to the bold contours of the region, in the abrupt
descent from the western slope of the Rocky Mountains to
the Pacific, the routes of travel are more strictly defined by
the physical geography of the country than in the long
stretches of the continent to the east of that mountain range.
An interchange of commodities between the tribes of the
coast and the interior appears to have been carried on from
remote times. Dr. Dawson’s own personal observations in
British Columbia have satisfied him that trading intercourse
was prosecuted by the coast tribes with those of the interior,
along the Fraser River Valley; Bella Coola Valley, from head
of Benetinck Arm; Skeena River; Stiking River; and Chilkoot
Pass, from the head of Lynn Canal. By the second of
the above routes oolacten oil was carried far into the interior;
and the old trail leading from Bella Coola and Fraser river is
chiefly associated by the inland Indians with this traffic. The
habitual traffic engendered by the local advantages of some
of the tribes on the northern Pacific coast has manifestly
developed some peculiarities which distinguish them from
other Indians of the northern continent. The Bilqula, a
people inhabiting a limited tract in the vicinity of Dean Inlet
and Benetinck Arms, by reason of their geographical position
have held command of the most important natural pass and
trade route from the ocean to the interior between the
Skeena and the Fraser rivers, a distance of upwards of 400
miles. From remotest times embraced in the native traditions
a route has been traversed by way of the Bella Coola river,
thence northward to the Salmon river, and then along the
north side of the Blackwater river to the Upper Fraser.
Dentalium shells and other prized objects of barter were
carried over this route; but the article of chief value brought
from the coast was the oil of the Oolacten or Candle Fish;
and hence this thoroughfare is commonly known among the
Tinné of the interior as the “Grease Trail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Along this and other long-frequented trails the broken
implements, flint and obsidian chips, and other traces of the
natives by whom they have been traversed, not only afford
proof of their presence there, but at times disclose indications
of the regions they have visited in going to or returning from
the interior. Dr. G. M. Dawson informs me that, while
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
travelling along various Indian trails and routes in British
Columbia, west of Fraser river, and between lats. 52° and
54°, chips and flakes of obsidian were not unfrequently observed.
The Tinné Indians stated that the material was
obtained from a mountain near the headwaters of the Salmon
river (about long. 125° 40′, lat. 52° 40′), which was formerly
resorted to for the purpose of procuring this prized material.
The Indian name of this mountain is <span class='it'>Bece</span>, and Dr. Dawson
further notes the suggestive fact that this word is the same
with the Mexican (Aztec?) name for “knife.” Mr. T. C.
Weston, of the Geological Survey, also noted, in 1883, the
finding of a flake of obsidian in connection with a layer
of buffalo-bones, occurring in alluvium, and evidently of considerable
antiquity, near Fort M’Leod, Alberta. The nearest
source of such a material is the Yellowstone Park region.
Those regions, it is obvious, were visited by native explorers,
not merely to supply their own wants, but for the purpose of
securing coveted objects available for trade or barter. Dr.
Dawson reports to me as the result of observations founded
on repeated visits to the region, in the work of the Geological
Survey: That all the coast tribes of British Columbia are born
traders, and possess in a high degree the mental characteristics
generally attributed to the Jews. Those holding possession of
the above routes regarded trade with the neighbouring inland
tribes as a valuable monopoly, and were ready to fight for it.
They also traded among themselves, and certain localities were
well known as the source of commodities. Thus the Haida
Indians regularly purchased oolacten oil from the Tshimsians,
who caught the oolacten at the mouth of the Nass and Stiking
rivers, giving in exchange cedar canoes, for the manufacture of
which they were celebrated. Through the agency of the
Tshimsians they also procured from the inland Indians the
large mountain sheep horns, from which they executed elaborately
carved spoons and other implements. Cumshewa, in
Queen Charlotte Islands, was, again, noted for Indian tobacco,
an undetermined native plant, which was an article of trade
all along the coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Copper was not unknown to the native tribes on the
Pacific coast, and rich supplies of the native metal appear to
have been partially worked, by the tribes along the shores of
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
Lake Superior from a remote date. The ancient mines have
been disclosed, in the process of turning their resources to
account by the enterprise of civilised settlers; and abundant
evidence has been recovered to show that the native copper of
the Keweenaw peninsula, Ontonagon, Isle Royale, and other
points on Lake Superior, was worked extensively by its ancient
miners, and undoubtedly formed a valuable object of traffic
throughout the region watered by the Mississippi and its
tributaries, and along the whole eastern routes to the seaboard.
But, with the imperfect resources of the native miners, it was
a costly rarity, procurable only in small quantities by barter
with the tribes settled on the shores of Lake Superior. Axe
blades, spear heads, knives, gorgets, armlets, tubes and beads,
all fashioned out of the native copper solely with the hammer,
have been recovered from ancient grave mounds and ossuaries
in the valleys of the St Lawrence, the Hudson, the Ohio, the
Mississippi, and their tributaries; and to the west of the
Rocky Mountains, copper implements again occur manufactured
from metal derived from some native source on the
Pacific slope. The copper was, no doubt, recognised as a
malleable rock, differing from all others in its ductility, so that
it could be fashioned, with the aid of a hammer-stone, to any
desired form. By this means the ancient miners of Lake
Superior provided themselves with the most suitable tools for
their mining operations, and were probably the manufacturers
of most of the widely diffused copper implements. But for
general purposes, both of industry and war, American man had
to be content with the more abundant chert, hornstone, and
quartzite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The source from whence the tribes on the Pacific obtained
the coveted metal has not yet been ascertained; but it was
obviously procured only in small quantities, insufficient to be
turned to account for economic uses. Among a curious collection
of objects illustrative of the arts of the Haida Indians,
now in the Museum of the Geological Survey at Ottawa, is a
large copper ring, or torque, which appears to have been
handed down for successive generations, from chief to chief, as
a prized heirloom; and, it may be assumed, as a symbol of
official rank. The ring, or necklet, is composed of three
twisted bars, or strands of hammered copper, each tapering at
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
both ends, and is fashioned with remarkable skill, if due
allowance be made for the imperfect tools of the native artificer.
This unique relic seems to show the accumulated
metallic wealth of the tribe fashioned into a symbol of official
rank; not improbably with mysterious virtues ascribed to it,
which passed with it to its official custodian. A block of
native copper now in the National Museum at Washington is
described by the Père Charlevoix as a sacred object of veneration
by the Indians of Lake Superior, on which a young
maiden had been offered in sacrifice.<a id='r29'/><a href='#f29' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[29]</span></sup></a> But it is beyond question
that throughout the region north of the Mexican Gulf the
native manufacturer resorted mainly to the abundant hornstone,
chert, quartzite, and the like materials of the Stone
period. These were in universal demand, and must have been
industriously collected in the localities where they abound,
and disposed of by a regular system of exchange for furs, wampum,
or other objects of barter. Mr W. H. Dall, in his report
on <span class='it'>The Tribes of the Extreme North-West</span>, notes the absence
in the Aleutian Islands of any stone, such as serpentine, fit for
making the celts or adzes, recovered by him from the shell
mounds. “They were,” he says, “probably imported from the
continental Innuit at great cost, and very highly valued”; and
on a subsequent page he adds: “The intertribal traffic I have
referred to is universal among the Innuit.”<a id='r30'/><a href='#f30' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[30]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The occurrence of well-stored caches in some of the ancient
mounds of the Ohio valley, as well as their repeated discovery
in other localities, accords with the idea of systematised industrial
labour, and the storing away of the needful supplies for
agricultural and domestic operations, and for war. Messrs.
Squier and Davis, in their <span class='it'>Ancient Monuments of the
Mississippi Valley</span>, describe one of the mounds opened by
them within the great earthwork on the North Fork of Point
Creek, in which, according to their estimate, about four thousand
hornstone disks were disposed in regular order, in successive
rows overlapping each other. In 1864, I had an
opportunity of examining some specimens retained in the
possession of Dr. Davis. They were mostly disks measuring
about six inches long and four wide, more or less oval, or
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
broad spear-shaped, and fashioned out of a fine gray flint with
considerable uniformity of character. Mr. Squier assumed that
the deposit was a religious offering; but subsequent disclosures
of a like character confirm the probability that it was a hoard
of material stored for the tool-maker.<a id='r31'/><a href='#f31' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[31]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>In other, though rarer cases, the cache has been found containing
finished implements. In digging a cellar at Trenton,
New Jersey, a deposit of one hundred and twenty finished
stone axes was brought to light, at a depth of about three feet
below the surface. Another discovery of a like character was
made when digging for the construction of a receiving vault of
the Riverview Cemetery, near Taunton; and similar deposits
are recorded as repeatedly occurring in the same state.<a id='r32'/><a href='#f32' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[32]</span></sup></a> In
two instances all the specimens were grooved axes. In
another, fifty porphyry celts were found deposited in systematic
order. Mr. Charles Rau has given the subject special
attention, and in a paper entitled “Ancient Aboriginal Trade
in North America,” he furnishes evidence of addiction to
certain manufactures, such as arrow heads, hoes and other
digging tools, spear heads, chisels, etc., by skilled native craftsmen.<a id='r33'/><a href='#f33' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[33]</span></sup></a>
Deposits closely corresponding to the one reported by
Mr. Squier as the sole contents of one of the mounds, in
“Clark’s Work,” Ohio, have been subsequently discovered in
Illinois, Wisconsin, and Kentucky. One of the Illinois
deposits contained about fifteen hundred leaf-shaped or
rounded disks of flint arranged in five horizontal layers.
Another, said to have contained three thousand five hundred
specimens, was discovered at Fredericksburg, in the same
state. A smaller, but more interesting hoard was accidentally
brought to light in 1868, when some labourers in opening
up a new street, at East St. Louis, in the same State of
Illinois, came upon a collection of large flint tools all of the
hoe and shovel type. There were about fifty of the former
and twenty of the latter, made of a yellowish-brown flint, and
betraying no traces of their having been used. Near by them
lay several large unworked blocks of flint and greenstone, and
many chippings and fragments of flint.<a id='r34'/><a href='#f34' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[34]</span></sup></a> Deposits of a like
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
character, but varying both in the number and diversity of
their contents, and, in general, showing no traces of use, have
been discovered in other states to the east of the Mississippi.
In the <span class='it'>Smithsonian Report</span> for 1877, Mr Rau prints a curious
account of “The Stock in Trade of an Aboriginal Lapidary.”
In the spring of the previous year Mr. Keenan presented to
the National Museum at Washington a collection of jasper
ornaments, mostly unfinished, which had been found in
Lawrence County, Mississippi. They were brought to light in
ploughing a cotton field, where a deposit was exposed, lying
about two and a half feet below the natural surface. It included
four hundred and sixty-nine objects, of which twenty-two
were unwrought jasper pebbles; one hundred and one
were beads of an elongated cylindrical shape, and a few of
them partially perforated. Others were ornaments of various
forms, including two animal-shaped objects. The whole were
made of jasper of a red or reddish colour, occasionally variegated
with spots or streaks of pale yellow, but nearly all were in an
unfinished state, and so fully bore out the idea of their being the
stock in trade of some old native workman, who finished them
in sufficient numbers to meet the demands of his customers.<a id='r35'/><a href='#f35' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[35]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>From time to time fresh disclosures prove the extent to
which such systematic industry was carried on. The various
collections thus brought to light were unquestionably the
result of prolonged labour, and were, for the most part,
undoubtedly stored for purposes of trade. In some cases they
may have been accumulated in the arsenal of the tribe in
readiness for war. But whether we recognise in such discoveries
the store of the trader, or the military arsenal, they
indicate ideas of provident foresight altogether distinct from
the desultory labours of the Indian savage in the preparation
of his own indispensable supply of implements for the chase or
for war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there were also, no doubt, home-made weapons and
implements, fashioned with patient industry out of the large
rolled serpentine, chalcedony, jasper, and agate pebbles, gathered
from the sea coast and river beds, or picked up wherever they
chanced to occur. When camping out on the Neepigon river,
with Indian guides from the Saskatchewan, I observed them
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
carefully collecting pieces of a metamorphic rock, underlying
the syenite cliffs, which, I learned from one of them, was
specially adapted for pipes. This they would carry a distance
of fully 800 miles before reaching their lodges on the
prairie. Dr. Robert Bell described to me a pipe made of fine
green serpentine, of a favourite Chipewyan pattern, which he
saw in the possession of an Indian on Nelson river. Its
owner resisted all attempts to induce him to part with it,
assigning as a reason of its special value that it had been
brought from Reindeer Lake distant several hundred miles
north of Frog Portage, on Churchill river. The diverse forms
in which various tribes shape the tobacco pipe are highly
characteristic. In some cases this is partly due to the texture
and degrees of hardness of the material employed; but the
recovery of pipes of nearly all the very diverse tribal patterns,
made from the beautiful catlinite, or red pipestone of the
Couteau des Prairies, leaves little room for doubt that the
stone was transported in rough blocks and bartered by its
quarriers to distant tribes. This flesh-coloured rock has
suggested the Sioux legend of its origin in the flesh of the
antediluvian red men, who perished there in the great deluge.
It is soft, of fine texture, and easily wrought into minutely
varied forms of Indian art, and so was coveted by the pipe-makers
of widely severed tribes. Hence red pipestone pipes
of many ingenious forms of sculpture have been recovered from
grave mounds down the Mississippi, eastward to the Atlantic
seaboard, and westward beyond the Rocky Mountains. This
prized material appears to have circulated among all the Plain
tribes. Pipes made of it were to be found in recent years
preserved as cherished possessions among both the Sioux and
the Blackfoot tribes. Dr. George M. Dawson found in 1874
part of an ancient catlinite pipe on Pyramid Creek, about lat.
49°, long. 105°.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A very different material was in use among the Assiniboin
Indians, limiting the art of the pipe sculptor to the simplest
forms. It is a fine marble, much too hard to admit of minute
carving, but susceptible of a high polish. This is cut into
pipes of graceful form, and made so extremely thin as to be
nearly transparent, so that when lighted the glowing tobacco
presents a singular appearance in a dark lodge. Another
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
favourite stone is a coarse species of jasper, also too hard for
any elaborate ornamentation. But the choice of materials is
by no means limited to those of the locality of the tribe. I
have already referred to my Indian guides carrying away with
them pieces of the pipestone rock on Neepigon river; and
Paul Kane, the artist, during his travels, when on Athabaska
river, near its source in the Rocky Mountains, observed his
Assiniboin guides select a favourite bluish jasper from among
the water-worn stones in the bed of the river, to carry home
for the purpose of pipe manufacture, although they were then
fully 500 miles from their lodges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The favourite material of the Chippewas was a dark, close-grained
schist obtained at some points on Lake Huron. It is
easily carved, and many of their pipes are decorated with
groups of human figures and animals, executed with much
spirit. Pabahmesad, an old Chippewa pipe-maker of unusual
skill, pursued his craft on Great Manitoulin Island, on Lake
Huron, in comparatively recent years. The peculiar style of
his ingenious carvings may be detected on pipes recovered
from widely scattered localities, for his fame as a pipe sculptor
was great. He was generally known among his people as
<span class='it'>Pwahguneka</span>, the pipe-maker. He obtained his materials from
the favourite resorts of different tribes, using the black pipestone
of Lake Huron, the white pipestone procured on St.
Joseph’s Island, and the catlinite or red pipestone of the
Couteau des Prairies. But the most varied and elaborate in
device of all the peculiar native types of pipe sculpture are
those executed by the Chimpseyan or Babeen and the Clalam
Indians, of Vancouver Island and the neighbouring shores
along Charlotte Sound. They are carved out of a soft blue
claystone or slate, from which also bowls, platters, and other
utensils are made, decorated with native legendary symbols
and other devices. But the most elaborate carving is reserved
for their pipes, which are not less varied and fanciful in design
than the details of Norman ecclesiastical sculpture. The same
easily carved claystone was in great request among the Haida
Indians of the Queen Charlotte Islands for their idols, and for
ornamental gorgets and utensils of various kinds. Thus the
available materials of different localities are seen to modify the
forms alike of implements, weapons, and articles designed for
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
personal ornament or domestic use, and were sought for and
transported to many distant points, with the same object as
the tin and copper which played so important a part in the
commercial exchanges of nations at the dawn of history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In regions where flint or hornstone is not available, the
quartzite appears to have been most commonly resorted to. I
have in my possession some spear heads measuring from seven
to nine inches long, which were dug up on an old Indian trail
at Point Oken, lying to the north of Lake St. John, Quebec;
and implements of the like material are common throughout
eastern Canada. The same widely diffused material was no
less freely resorted to by the tribes on the Pacific coast. The
arrow heads found throughout the Salish country of southern
British Columbia are chiefly formed of quartzite, though chert
is also used. The quartzite occurs in so many localities that
it is difficult to trace its special source. But near the east end
of Marble Cañon, and at the Big Bock Slide, about six miles
above Spence’s Bridge, on Thompson river, chips occur in
considerable quantities, suggestive of one of the chosen localities
resorted to for quarrying and manufacture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old arrow-makers evidently derived pleasure from the
selection of attractive materials for some of their choicest
specimens of handiwork. The true crystalline quartz was
prized for small arrow heads, some of which are equally
pleasing in material, form, and delicacy of finish. But the
material most usually employed in eastern Canada, as well as
that previously referred to as in request by the old workers
of the Ohio valley for their largest implements, is a gneissoid
rock of comparatively common occurrence, which chips off
with a broad facet when sharply struck, and leaves an acute
edge and point. Mr. Seller’s valuable paper on the ancient
workshops of Ohio and Pennsylvania also contains an account
of his own experience relative to the flaking and chipping of
flint implements.<a id='r36'/><a href='#f36' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[36]</span></sup></a> In this communication he remarks: “Most
of the arrow points found within my reach in Philadelphia,
Delaware, and Chester Counties, Pennsylvania, were chipped
from massive quartz, from the opaque white to semi-transparent,
and occasionally transparent.” He further describes his first
chance discovery of one of the native work-places. He was in
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
company with two scientific mineralogists, when, as he writes,
“we came to a place where (judging from the quantities of
flakes and chips) arrow points had been made. After much
diligent search, only one perfect point was found. There
were many broken ones, showing the difficulty in working the
material. Mr. Lukins, a scientific mineralogist, collected a
quantity of the best flakes to experiment with, and, by the
strokes of a light hammer, roughed out one or two very rude
imitations.” Major J. H. Long traversed the continent westward
to the Rocky Mountains, as head of the United States
Military Topographical Department; and from him Mr. Sellers
derived information of the habits of the rude western tribes
long before they had been brought into direct contact with
any civilised settlers. “He said that flakes prepared for
points and other implements seemed to be an object of trade
or commerce among the Indian tribes that he came in contact
with; that there were but few places where chert or quartzite
was found of sufficient hardness, and close and even grain, to
flake well, and at those places there were men very expert at
flaking.”<a id='r37'/><a href='#f37' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[37]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Sellers had known Catlin, the artist and traveller, in
his youth, while he was still an expert worker in wood and
ivory in the service of the elder Catlin, a musical instrument
maker in Philadelphia; and from him he learned much relative
to the modes of operation and the sources of material of the
Indian workers in stone. “He considered making flakes much
more of an art than the shaping them into arrow or spear
points, for a thorough knowledge of the nature of the stone
to be flaked was essential, as a slight difference in its quality
necessitated a totally different mode of treatment. The
principal source of supply for what he termed home-made
flakes was the coarse gravel bars of the rivers, where large
pebbles are found. Those most easily worked into flakes for
small arrow points were chalcedony, jasper, and agate. Most
of the tribes had men who were expert at flaking, and who
could decide at sight the best mode of working. Some of
these pebbles would split into tolerably good flakes by quick
and sharp blows, striking on the same point. Others would
break by a cross fracture into two or more pieces. These
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
were preferred, as good flakes could be split from their clean
fractured surface, by what Mr. Catlin called ‘impulsive
pressure,’ the tool used being a shaft or stick of between two
and three inches in diameter, varying in length from thirty
inches to four feet, according to the manner of using them.
These were pointed with bone or buckhorn.” It is thus
apparent that among rude tribes of modern centuries, as in
the prehistoric dawn, exceptional aptitude and skill found
recognition as readily as in any civilised community. There
were the quarriers and the skilled workmen, on whose joint
labours the whole community largely depended for the indispensable
supply of all needful tools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the summer of 1854, when civilisation had made very
slight inroads on the western wilderness, I visited a group of
Chippewa lodges on the south-west shore of Lake Superior,
where they still maintained many of their genuine habits.
Their aged chief, Buffalo, was a fine specimen of the uncorrupted
savage, dressed in native attire, and wearing the collar
of grizzly bear’s claws as proof of his triumph over the
fiercest object of the chase. Their weapons were partly of
iron, derived from the traders. But they had also their stone-tipped
arrows; and one Indian was an object of interest to
a group of Indian boys as he busied himself in fashioning
a water-worn pebble into an edged tool. He held an oval
pebble between the finger and thumb, and used it with quick
strokes as a hammer. But he was only engaged on the first
rough process, and I did not see the completion of his work.
No doubt, the leisure of all was turned more or less to account
in supplying themselves with their ordinary weapons and
missiles. But Catlin’s free intercourse with the wild western
tribes familiarised him with the regular sources of general
supply. “The best flakes,” he said, “outside of the homemade,
were a subject of commerce, and came from certain
localities where the chert of the best quality was quarried in
sheets or blocks, as it occurs in almost continuous seams in
the intercalated limestones of the coal measures. These seams
are mostly cracked or broken into blocks that show the nature
of the cross fracture, which is taken advantage of by the
operators, who seemed to have reduced the art of flaking to
almost an absolute science, with division of labour; one set
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
of men being expert in quarrying and selecting the stone,
others in preparing the blocks for the flakers.”<a id='r38'/><a href='#f38' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[38]</span></sup></a> But suitable
and specially prized material were sometimes sought on different
sites, and disseminated from them by the primitive trader.
Along eastern Labrador and in Newfoundland arrow heads
are mostly fashioned out of a peculiar light-gray translucent
quartzite. Dr. Bell informs me that near Chimo, south of
Ungava Bay, is a spot resorted to by the Indians from time immemorial
for this favourite material; and arrows made of it are
not uncommon even in Nova Scotia. Among the tribes remote
from the sea coast, where no exposed rock furnished available
material for the manufacture of their stone implements, the
chief source of supply was the larger pebbles of the river beds.
From these the most suitable stones were carefully selected,
and often carried great distances. Those most easily worked
into flakes for small arrow heads are chalcedony, jasper, agate,
and quartz; and the finer specimens of such weapons are now
greatly prized by collectors. The coast tribes both of the
Atlantic and the Pacific found similar sources of supply of the
stones best suited for their implements in the rolled gravel of
the beach, and this appears to have been the most frequent
resort of the Micmacs and other tribes of the Canadian
Maritime Provinces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have already referred to information derived from Dr. G.
M. Dawson and Dr. Robert Bell, to both of whom I have been
indebted for interesting results of their own personal observations
as members of the Canadian Geological Survey. Collectors
are familiar with the elongated flat stones, with two or more
holes bored through them, variously styled gorgets, implements
for fashioning sinew into cord, etc. They are made of a
grayish-green clay slate, with dark streaks; and the same
material is used in the manufacture of personal ornaments,
ceremonial objects, and occasionally for smooth spear heads
and knives. Relics fashioned of this peculiar clay slate are
found throughout Ontario, from Lakes Huron and Erie to the
Ottawa valley. A somewhat similar stone occurs in situ at
various points, but Dr. Bell believes he has satisfactorily
identified the ancient quarry at the outlet of Lake Temagamic,
nearly 100 miles north of Lake Nipissing. No clay slate
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
procured from any other locality corresponds so exactly to
the favourite material. The site is accessible by more than
one canoe route; and quantities of the rock from different beds
lie broken up in blocks of a size ready for transportation.
Dr. Bell found on the shore of Lake Temissaming a large
unfinished spear head, chipped out of this clay slate, and ready
for grinding. When the region is settled and the land cleared,
sites will probably be discovered where the aboriginal exporters
reduced the rough blocks to forms convenient for transport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Bell has described to me specimens of narrow and
somewhat long spear points, of local manufacture, made from
smoky chert found on or near the Athabaska, in Mackenzie river
basin; and an arrow head of brown flint from the mouth of
Churchill river, Hudson Bay. The flint implements of Rainy
river and Lake of the Woods are of brownish flint and chert,
such as are found in the drift all over the region to the south-westward
of Hudson Bay; and are mostly derived from the
Devonian rocks. Worn pebbles of this kind occur in the drift
as far south as Lake Superior. A branch of Kinogami river
is called by the Indians Flint river (<span class='it'>Pewona sipi</span>) from the
abundance of the favourite material they find in the river
gravel and shingle. The finest flint implements of Canada
are those of the north shore of Lake Huron, made from
material corresponding to a very fine-grained quartzite,
approximating to chalcedony, found among the Huronian
rocks of that region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Along the western coast of the Province of Nova Scotia a
high ridge of trap rock extends, with slight interruption, from
Briar Island to Cape Blomidon. Here the strong tidal rush
of the sea undermines the cliff, and the winter frosts split it
up, so that every year the shore is strewn with broken fragments
from the cliff, exposing a variety of crystalline minerals,
such as jasper, agate, etc. The beach gravel is also interspersed
with numerous rounded pebbles derived originally
from the same source. I am indebted to Mr. George Patterson,
of New Glasgow, N.S., for some interesting notes on this subject.
The pebbles of this beach seem to have been one of the chief
sources of supply for the Indian implement-makers of Nova
Scotia. Few localities have hitherto been noticed in the
Maritime Provinces marked by any such large accumulation
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
of chips as would suggest the probability of manufacture for
the purpose of trade; though chips and finished implements
occasionally occur together on the sites of Indian villages or
encampments, suggestive of individual industry and home
manufacture. But Mr. Patterson informs me that one
place at Bauchman’s Beach, in the county of Lunenburg,
furnishes abundant traces of an old native workshop. There,
until recently, could be gathered agate, jasper, and other
varieties of the fine-grained crystalline minerals from the
trap, sometimes in nodules, rounded and worn, as they occur
at the base of the ocean-washed cliffs. At times they showed
partial traces of working; but more frequently they were split
and broken, bearing the unmistakable marks of the hammer.
Along with those were cores and large quantities of flakes, or
chips, with arrow heads, more or less perfectly formed. At
one time they might have been gathered in large quantities;
but recent inroads of the sea have swept away much of the
old beach, and strewed the products of the Indian stone-workers
where they may be stored for the wonder of men of other
centuries. It is curious, indeed, to reflect on the memorials
of ages so diverse from those with which the palæontologist
deals, that are now accumulating in the submarine strata in
process of formation, for the instruction of coming generations,
should our earth last so long. The world will, doubtless, have
grown wiser before that epoch is reached. But it will require
some discrimination, even in so enlightened an age, to read
aright the significance of this mingling of relics of rudest
barbarism with all the products of modern civilisation that are
being strewn along the great ocean highways between the
Old and the New World.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A curious illustration of the possible confusion of evidence
is shown by the discovery in 1884 of a large stone lance
head of the Eskimo type, deeply imbedded in the tissues of a
whale taken at the whaling station on Ballast Point, near the
harbour of San Diego, California.<a id='r39'/><a href='#f39' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[39]</span></sup></a> In the Museum of the
University of Edinburgh is the skeleton of a whale, stranded
in the ancient estuary of the Forth in a prehistoric age, when
the ocean tides reached the site which had been elevated into
dry land long ages before the Roman invaders of Caledonia
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
made their way over it. Alongside of the buried whale lay
a rude deerhorn implement of the old Caledonian whaler; and
had the San Diego whale sunk in deep waters off the Pacific
coast, it would have perpetuated a similar memorial of rudest
savage life, in close proximity, doubtless, to evidences of modern
civilisation. Such, though in less striking form, is the process
of intermingling the arts of the American Stone age with
products of modern skill and refinement, that is now in progress
off the Lunenburg coast of Nova Scotia. The inroads of the
sea have not, however, even now effaced all traces of the old
arrow-makers of Bauchman’s Beach. Specimens of their
handiwork may still be gathered along the shore. To this
locality it is obvious that the inland tribes resorted from
remote Indian villages for some of their most indispensable
supplies. Implements of the same materials also occur at
sites on the northern coast; but the larger number found there
are made of quartzite, felsite, or of hard, slaty stone, such as
occurs in the metamorphic rocks of the mountain ranges in
the interior of the Province.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From what has thus been set forth, some general inferences
of a comprehensive character are suggested. It is scarcely
open to doubt that at a very early stage in the development of
primitive mechanical art, the exceptional aptitude of skilled
workmen was recognised and brought into use for the general
benefit. Co-operation and some division of labour in the
industrial arts, necessary to meet the universal demand for
tools and weapons, appear also to have been recognised from a
very remote period in the social life of the race. There were
the quarriers for the flint, the obsidian, the shale, the pipestones,
the favourite minerals, and the close-grained igneous
rocks, adapted for the variety of implements in general use.
There were also the traders by whom the raw material was
transported to regions where it could only be procured by
barter; as appears to be demonstrated by the repeated
discovery, not only of flint and stone implements, alike in
stray examples, and in well-furnished caches; but also of work-places,
remote from any flint-producing formation, strewn with
the chips, flakes, and imperfect or unfinished implements of
the tool-makers. It thus becomes obvious that the men of the
earliest Stone age transported suitable material for their simple
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
arts from many remote localities, and purchased the services
of the skilled workman with the produce of the chase, or
whatever other equivalent they could offer in exchange. The
further archæological search is extended, the evidence of social
co-operation and systematised industry among the men of the
Palæolithic era, as well as among those of later periods prior to
the dawn of metallurgic skill, becomes more apparent. Nor is
it less interesting to note that there was no more equality
among the men of those primitive ages, than in later civilised
stages of social progress. Diversities in capacity and consequent
moral force asserted themselves in the skilled handicraftsmen
of the Palæolithic dawn, much as they do in the most artificial
states of modern society. As a natural concomitant to this,
and an invaluable element of co-operation, the prized flint flakes
appear to have furnished a primitive medium of exchange, more
generally available as a currency of recognised value than any
other substitute for coined money. The principles on which
the wealth of nations and the whole social fabric of human
society depend, were thus already in operation ages before the
merchants of Tyre, or the traders of Massala, had learned to
turn to account the mineral resources of the Cassiterides; or
that vaguer and still more remote era before the ancient
Atlantis had vanished from the ken of the civilised dwellers
around the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span><h1>IV<br/> PRE-ARYAN AMERICAN MAN</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> department of American ethnology, notwithstanding its
many indefatigable workers, is still to a large extent a virgin
soil. The western hemisphere is rich in materials for ethnical
study, but there is urgent demand for diligent labourers to
rescue them for future use. On all hands we see ancient
nations passing away. The prairie tribes are vanishing with
the buffalo; the Flathead Indians of diverse types and stranger
tongues; and, more interesting than either, the ingenious
Haidahs of the Queen Charlotte Islands: are all diminishing
in numbers, giving up their distinctive customs, and confusing
their mythic and legendary traditions with foreign admixtures;
while some are destined to speedy extinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, in 1846, the artist, Paul Kane, entered on his
exploratory travels among the tribes of the North-West, the
Flathead Indians of Oregon and British Columbia embraced
populous settlements of Cowlitz, Chinook, Newatee, and other
nations. Now the researches of the American Bureau of
Ethnology are stimulated by the disclosure that of the Clatsop
and Chinook tribes there are only three survivors who speak
the former language, and only one with a knowledge of the
latter. Of the Klaskanes, in like manner, only one is known
to survive; and from a like solitary representative of the
Tuteloes the language of a vanished race has recently been
rescued. With all the native tribes who have been brought
into near relations with the intruding white race their
languages and customs are undergoing important modifications.
Other elements of confusion and erasure are also at work. A
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>
large influx of Chinese complicates the ethnological problem;
and it cannot be wisely left to the efforts of individuals, carried
on without concert, and on no comprehensive or systematic
plan, to rescue for future study the invaluable materials of
American ethnology. To the native languages especially the
inquirer into some of the curious problems involved in the
peopling of this continent must look for a key to the mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intelligent inquirer cannot fail to be rewarded for any
time he may devote to a consideration of the condition and
relative status of the aborigines, north of the Gulf of Mexico,
not only as studied from existing native tribes, or from those
known since the discovery of America in 1492, but in so far
as we can determine their earlier condition with the aid of
archæological evidence. The student of the history of the
North American nations cannot indeed altogether overlook the
undoubted fact that Columbus was not the first of European
voyagers within the Christian era to enter on the colonisation
of the western hemisphere; whatever value he may attach to
the legends and traditions of more ancient explorers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The part played by the Scandinavian stock in European
history proves their abundant aptitude to have been the
organisers of a Northland of their own in the New World.
The Northmen lingered behind, in their first home in the
Scandinavian peninsula, while Goth, Longobard, Vandal,
Suevi, Frank, Burgundian, and other tribes from the Baltic first
wasted and then revolutionised the Roman world. But they
were nursing a vigorous youth, which ere long, as pagan Dane,
and then as Norman, stamped a new character on mediæval
Europe. Their presence in the New World rests on indubitable
evidence; but the very definiteness of its character in their
inhospitable northern retreat helps to destroy all faith in any
mere conjectural fancies relative to their settlement on points
along the Atlantic seaboard which they are supposed to have
visited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Runic inscriptions on the Canadian and New England
seaboard would, if genuine, give an entirely novel aspect to
our study of Pre-Columbian American history, with all its
possibilities of older intercourse with the eastern hemisphere.
But it is the same whether we seek for traces of colonisation in
the tenth or the fifteenth century, in so far as all native history
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
is concerned. They equally little suffice to furnish evidence
of relationship, in blood, language, arts or customs, between
any people of the eastern hemisphere and the native American
races. We are indeed invited from time to time to review
indications suggestive of an Asiatic or other old-world source
for the American aborigines; and in nearly every system of
ethnical classification they are, with good reason, ranked as
Mongolidæ; but if their pedigree is derived from an Asiatic
stock, the evidence has yet to be marshalled which shall place
on any well-established basis the proofs of direct ethnical affinity
between them and races of the eastern hemisphere. The
ethnological problem is, here as elsewhere, beset by many
obscuring elements. Language, at best, yields only remote
analogies, and thus far American archæology, though studied
with unflagging zeal, has been able to render very partial aid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It cannot admit of question that the compass of American
archæology,—including that of the semi-civilised and lettered
races of Central and Southern America,—is greatly circumscribed
in comparison with that of Europe. But the simplicity which
results from this has some compensating elements in its direct
adaptation to the study of man, as he appears on the continent
unaffected by the artificialities of a forced civilisation, and
with so little that can lend countenance to any theory of
degeneracy from a higher condition of life. In the modern
alliance between archæology and geology, and the novel
views which have resulted as to the antiquity of man,
the characteristic disclosures of primitive art, alike among
ancient and modern races, have given a significance to familiar
phases of savage life undreamt of till very recently. The
student who has by such means formed a definite conception
of primeval art, and realised some idea of the condition and
acquirements of the savage of Europe’s Post-Pliocene era, turns
with renewed interest to living races seemingly perpetuating in
arts and habits of our own day what gave character to the social
life of the prehistoric dawn. This phase of primitive art can
still be studied on more than one continent, and in many an
island of the Pacific and the Indian ocean; but nowhere is
the apparent reproduction of such initial phases of the history
of our race presented in so comprehensive an aspect as on the
American continent. There man is to be found in no degree
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
superior in arts or habits to the Australian savage; while
evidence of ingenious skill and of considerable artistic taste
occur among nomads exposed to the extremest privations of
an Arctic climate; and with no more knowledge of metallurgy
than is implied in occasionally turning to account the malleable
native copper, by hammering it into the desired shape; or, in
their intercourse with Arctic voyagers and Hudson’s Bay
trappers, acquiring by barter some few implements and
weapons of European manufacture. The arts of the patient
Eskimo, exercised under the stimulus of their constant struggle
for existence amid all the hardships of a polar climate, have,
indeed, not only suggested comparisons between them and the
artistic cave-dwellers of Central Europe in its prehistoric dawn;
but have been assumed to prove an ethnical affinity, and direct
descent, altogether startling when we fully realise the remote
antiquity thereby assigned to those Arctic nomads, and the
unchanging condition ascribed to them through all the intervening
ages of geographical and social revolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But whatever may be the value ultimately assigned to the
Eskimo pedigree, a like phenomenon of unprogressive humanity,
perpetuating through countless generations the same rudimentary
arts, everywhere presents itself, and seems to me to constitute
the really remarkable feature in North American ethnology and
archæology. We find, not only in Canada but throughout the
whole region northward from the Gulf of Mexico, diversified
illustrations of savage life; but nearly all of them unaffected by
traces of contact with earlier civilisation. From the northern
frontiers of Canada the explorer may travel through widely
diversified regions till he reach the cañons of Mexico and the
ruined cities of Central America; and all that he finds of race
and art, of language or native tradition, is in contrast to the
diversities of the European record of manifold successions of
races and of arts. There within the Arctic circle the Eskimo
constructs his lodge of snow, and successfully maintains the
battle for life under conditions which determine to a large
extent the character of his ingenious arts and manufacture.
Immediately to the south are found the nomad tribes of forest
and prairie, with their téepees of buffalo-skin, or their birch-bark
wigwams and canoes: wandering hunter tribes of the
great North-West; type of the red Indian of the whole northern
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
continent. The Ohio and Mississippi valleys abound with
earthworks and other remains of the vanished race of the
Mound-Builders: of old the dwellers there in fortified towns,
agriculturalists, ingenious potters, devoted to the use of tobacco,
expending laborious art on their sculptured pipes, and with
some exceptionally curious skill in practical geometry; yet,
they too, ignorant of almost the very rudiments of metallurgy,
and only in the first stage of the organised life of a settled
community. The modifying influences of circumstances must
be recognised in the migratory or settled habits of different
tribes. The Eskimo are of necessity hunters and fishers, yet
they are not, strictly speaking, nomads. In summer they live
in tents, constantly moving from place to place, as the exigencies
of the reindeer-hunting, seal-hunting, or fishing impel them.
But they generally winter in the same place for successive
generations, and manifest as strong an attachment to their
native home as the dwellers in more favoured lands. Their
dwelling-houses accommodate from three or four to ten families;
and the same tendency to gather in communities under one
roof is worthy of notice wherever other wandering tribes settle
even temporarily. A drawing, made by me in 1866, of a
birch-bark dwelling which stood among a group of ordinary
wigwams on the banks of the Kaministiquia, shows a lodge
of sufficiently large dimensions to accommodate several families
of a band of Chippewas, who had come from the far West to
trade their furs with the Hudson’s Bay factor there. The
Haidahs, the Chinooks, the Nootkas, the Columbian and other
Indian tribes to the west of the Rocky Mountains, all use
temporary tents or huts in their frequent summer wanderings;
but their permanent dwellings are huge structures sufficient to
accommodate many families, and sometimes the whole tribe.
They are constructed of logs or split planks, and in some
cases, as among the Haidahs of Queen Charlotte Islands, they
are elaborately decorated with carving and painting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gregarious habits thus manifested by many wandering
tribes, whenever circumstances admit of their settling down in a
permanent home, may be due mainly to the economy of labour
which experience has taught them in the construction of one
common dwelling, instead of the multiplication of single huts
or lodges. But far to the southward are the ancient pueblos,
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
the casas grandes, the cliff dwellings, of a race not yet extinct:
timid, unaggressive, living wholly on the defensive, gathered in
large communities like ants or bees; industrious, frugal, and
manifesting ingenious skill in their pottery and other useful
arts; but, they too, in no greatly advanced stage. Still farther
to the south we come at length to the seats of an undoubted
native American civilisation. The comparative isolation of
Central America, and the character of its climate and productions,
all favoured a more settled life; with, as genuine
results, its architecture, sculpture, metallurgy, hieroglyphics,
writing, and all else that gives so novel a character to the
memorials of the Central American nations. But great as is
their contrast with the wild tribes of the continent, the highest
phases of native civilisation will not compare with the arts of
Egypt, in centuries before Cadmus taught letters to the rude
shepherds of Attica, or the wolf still suckled her cubs on the
Palatine hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If this is a correct reading of American archæology, its
bearings are significant in reference to the whole history of
American man. In Europe the student of primitive antiquity
is habitually required to discriminate between products of ingenious
skill belonging to periods and races widely separated
alike by time and by essentially diverse stages of progress in
art. For not only do its Palæolithic and Neolithic periods long
precede the oldest written chronicles; but even its Aryan
colonisation lies beyond any record of historic beginnings.
The civilisation which had already grown up around the
Mediterranean Sea while the classic nations were in their
infancy, extended its influences not only to what was strictly
regarded as transalpine Europe, but beyond the English
Channel and the Baltic, centuries before the Rhine and Danube
formed the boundary of the Roman world. Voltaire, when
treating of the morals and spirit of nations, says: “It is not in
the nature of man to desire that which he does not know.”
But it is certainly in his nature, at any rate, to desire much
that he does not possess; and the cravings of the rudest outlying
tribes of ancient Europe must have been stimulated by
many desires of which those of the New World were unconscious
till the advent of Europeans in the fifteenth century
brought them into contact with a long-matured civilisation.
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The archæology of the American continent is, in this respect,
at least, simple. Its student is nowhere exposed to misleading
or obscuring elements such as baffle the European explorer
from the intermingling of relics of widely diverse eras, or even
such a succession of arts of the most dissimilar character as
Dr. Schliemann found on the site of the classic Ilium. The
history of America cannot repeat that of Europe. Its great river-valleys
and vast prairies present a totally different condition of
things from that in which the distinctive arts, languages, and
nationalities of Europe have been matured. The physical
geography of the latter with its great central Alpine chain, its
highlands, its dividing seas, its peninsulas, and islands, has
necessarily fostered isolation; and so has tended to develop the
peculiarities of national character, as well as to protect incipient
civilisation and immature arts from the constant erasures of
barbarism. The steppes of Asia in older centuries proved
the nurseries of hordes of rude warriors, powerful only for
spoliation. The evidence of the isolation of the nations of
Europe in early centuries is unmistakable. Scarcely any
feature in the history of the ancient world is more strange to
us now than the absence of all direct intercourse between
countries separated only by the Alps, or even by the Danube
or the Rhine. “The geography of Greek experience, as exhibited
by Homer, is limited, speaking generally, to the Ægean
and its coasts, with the Propontis as its limit in the north-east;
with Crete for a southern boundary; and with the addition of
the western coast of the peninsula and its islands as far northwards
as the Leucadian rock. The key to the great contrast
between the outer geography and the facts of nature lies in the
belief of Homer that a great sea occupied the space where we
know the heart of the European continent to lie.”<a id='r40'/><a href='#f40' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[40]</span></sup></a> To the
early Romans the Celtic nations were known only as warlike
nomads whose incursions from beyond the Alpine frontier of
their little world were perpetuated in the half-legendary tales
of their own national childhood. To the Greek even of the
days of Herodotus no more was known of the Gauls or
Germans than the rumours brought by seamen and
traders whose farthest voyage was to the mouth of the
Rhone.
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, indeed, difficult for us now, amid the intimate relations
of the modern world, and the interchange of products of
the remotest east and west, to realise a condition of things
when the region beyond the Alps was a mystery to the Greek
historian, and the very existence of the river Rhine was
questioned; or when, four centuries later, the nations around
the Baltic, which were before long to supplant the masters of
the Roman world, were so entirely unknown to them that, as
Dr. Arnold remarks, in one of his letters: “The Roman colonies
along the Rhine and the Danube looked out on the country
beyond those rivers as we look up at the stars, and actually see
with our own eyes a world of which we know nothing.” Yet
such ignorance was not incompatible with indirect intercourse;
and was so far from excluding the barbarians beyond the Alps
or the Baltic from all the fruits of the civilisation which grew
up around the Mediterranean Sea, that the elements of the
oldest runic epigraphy of the Goths and Scandinavians are
traced to that source; and the stamp of Hellenic influence is
apparent in the later runic writing. Moreover the elucidation
of European archæology has owed its chief impediment to the
difficulty of discriminating between arts of diverse eras and
races of northern Europe, intermingled with those of its
Neolithic and Bronze periods; or of separating them from the
true products of Celtic and classic workmanship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is altogether different with American archæology. Were
there any traces there of Celtic, Roman, or mediæval European
art, the whole tendency of the American mind would be to
give even an exaggerated value to their influence. Superficial
students of the ruins of Mexico and Central America have
misinterpreted characteristics pertaining to what may not
inaptly be designated instincts common to the human mind in
its first efforts at visible expression of its ideas; and have
recognised in them fancied analogies with ancient Egyptian
art, or with the mythology and astronomical science of the
East. Had, indeed, the more advanced nations of the New
World borrowed the arts of Egypt, India, or Greece, the great
river highways and the vast unbroken levels of the northern
continent presented abundant facilities for their diffusion, with
no greater aid than the birch-bark canoe of the northern
savage. The copper of Lake Superior was familiar to nations
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
on the banks of the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, the Hudson,
and the Delaware. Nor was the influence of southern civilisation
wholly inoperative. Reflex traces of the prolific fancy of
the Peruvian potter may be detected in the rude ware of the
mounds of Georgia and Tennessee; and the conventional art
of Yucatan reappears in the ornamentation of the lodges of the
Haidahs of Queen Charlotte’s Islands, and in the wood and
ivory carvings of the Tawatin and other tribes of British
Columbia. Already, moreover, the elaborate native devices
which give such distinctive character to the ivory and claystone
carvings of the Chimpseyan and Clalam Indians, have been
largely superseded by reproductions of European ornamentation,
or literal representations of houses, shipping, horses, fire-arms,
and other objects brought under the notice of the native artist
in his intercourse with white men. We are justified, therefore,
in assuming that no long-matured civilisation could have
existed in any part of the American continent without leaving,
not only abundant evidence of its presence within its own
area, but also many traces of its influence far beyond. Yet
it cannot be said of the vanished races of the North American
continent that they died and made no sign. Their memorials
are abundant, and some of their earthworks and burial mounds
are on a gigantic scale. But they perpetuate no evidence of a
native civilisation of elder times bearing the slightest analogy
to that of Europe through all its historic centuries. The
western hemisphere stands a world apart, with languages and
customs essentially its own; and with man and his arts embraced
within greatly narrower limits of development than in
any other quarter of the globe, if we except Australia. The
evolutionist may, indeed, be tempted by the absence not only
of the anthropoid apes, but by all but the lowest families of the
<span class='it'>Primates</span>, to regard man as a recent intruder on the American
continent. But in this, as in the archæologist’s deductions, the
term “recent” is a relative one. To whatever source American
man may be referred, his relations to the old-world races are
sufficiently remote to preclude any theory of geographical distribution
within the historic period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not, therefore, adequate time that is wanting for the
growth of a native American civilisation. The only satisfactory
indication of the affiliation of the American races to those
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
of Asia or Europe, or of Africa, must be sought for in their
languages. But any trace of this kind, thus far observed, is at
best obscure and remote. The resemblance in physical traits
points to affinity with the Asiatic Mongol, and the agglutinate
characteristics common to many languages of the continent,
otherwise essentially dissimilar, is in harmony with this. But
Asiatic affinities are only traceable remotely, not demonstrable
on any definite line of descent; and all the evidence that
language supplies points to a greatly prolonged period of
isolation. The number of languages spoken throughout the
whole of North and South America has been estimated to
considerably exceed twelve hundred; and on the northern
continent alone, more than five hundred distinct languages
are spoken, which admit of classification among seventy-five
ethnical groups, each with essential linguistic distinctions,
pointing to its own parent stock. Some of those languages
are merely well-marked dialects, with fully developed vocabularies.
Others have more recently acquired a dialectic character
in the breaking up and scattering of dismembered tribes, and
present a very limited range of vocabulary, suited to the intellectual
requirements of a small tribe, or band of nomads. The
prevailing condition of life throughout the whole North American
continent was peculiarly favourable to the multiplication of
such dialects, and their growth into new languages, owing to
the constant dismemberment of tribes, and the frequent
adoption into their numbers of the refugees from other
fugitive broken tribes, leading to an intermingling of vocabularies
and fresh modifications of speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, by whatever means we seek to account for the great
diversity of speech among the communities of the New World,
it is manifest that language furnishes no evidence of recent
intrusion, or of contact for many generations with Asiatic or
other races. On any theory of origin either of race or
language, a greatly prolonged period is indispensable to account
for the actual condition of things which presents such a
tempting field for the study of the ethnologist. Among the
various races brought under notice, the Huron-Iroquois of
Canada and the neighbouring states most fitly represent the
North American race east of the Rocky Mountains. Their
language, subdivided into many dialects, furnishes indications
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
of migrations throughout the greater portion of that area eastward
between the Mississippi and the Atlantic seaboard, and
its affinities have been sought for beyond the American continent.
Mr. Horatio Hale, an experienced philologist familiar
with the races and languages most nearly akin to those of
the New World, in his <span class='it'>Indian Migrations, as evidenced by
Language</span>, after remarking that there is nothing in the languages
of the American Indians to favour the conjecture of an origin
from Eastern Asia, thus proceeds: “But in Western Europe
one community is known to exist, speaking a language which
in its general structure manifests a near likeness to the Indian
tongues. Alone of all the races of the old continent the
Basques or Euskarians, of northern Spain and south-western
France, have a speech of that highly complex and polysynthetic
character which distinguishes the American languages.” But
to this he has to add the statement that “there is not, indeed,
any such positive similarity in words or grammar as would
prove a direct affiliation. The likeness is merely in the general
cast and mould of speech, but this likeness is so marked as to
have awakened much attention.”<a id='r41'/><a href='#f41' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[41]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Assuming the affinity thus based on a general likeness in
cast and mould of speech to be well founded, there need be no
surprise at the lack of any positive similarity in words or
grammar; for, used only as a test of the intervening time since
Basque and Red Indian parted, it points to representatives of a
prehistoric race that occupied Europe before the advent of
Celtic or other Aryan pioneer, long prior to the historic dawn.
And if the intervening centuries between that undetermined
date and the close of the fifteenth century, when intercourse
was once more renewed between the Iberian peninsula and the
transatlantic continent, sufficed for the evolution of all the
classic, mediæval, and renaissance phases of civilisation in
Europe, what was man doing through all those centuries in
this New World? A period of time would appear to have
transpired ample enough for the development of a native
civilisation; but neither the languages nor the arts of the
Indian nations found in occupation of the northern continent
reveal traces of it; nor does archæology disclose to us evidence
of civilised precursors. Whatever their origin may have been,
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
the Red Indian appears to have remained for unnumbered
centuries excluded by ocean barriers from all influence of the
historic races. But on this very account an inquiry into the
history of the nations of the American continent, in so far as
this may be recoverable from archæological or other evidence,
may simplify important ethnical problems, and contribute results
of some value in reference to the condition and progress
of primeval man elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Europe man can be studied only as he has been moulded
by a thousand external influences, and by the intermixture of
many dissimilar races. The most recent terms of ethnological
classification, the Xanthocroi and Melanochroi, are based on the
assumed interblending of widely dissimilar races in times long
anterior to any definite chronology. There was a time, as is
assumed, when the sparsely peopled areas of Europe were
occupied by a population still imperfectly represented by the
Finns, the Lapps, and the Basques. Those are supposed to be
surviving fragments of a once homogeneous population in prehistoric
centuries. On this the great Aryan migration intruded
in successive waves of Celtic, Slavic, Hellenic and Teutonic
invaders, not without considerable intermixture of blood.
Such is the great ethnical revolution by which it is assumed
that Europe was recolonised from the same source from whence
India and Persia derived their ancient civilised and lettered
races. The Finnic hypothesis, and the once favoured idea of
an Asiatic cradleland for the whole so-called Aryan races,
have been greatly modified by later research. Community of
language is no longer accepted as necessarily involving a common
ethnic origin. But the results in no way affect the general
conclusion as to the displacement of a succession of barbarous
races by the historic races of Europe long before the Christian
era.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The year 1492 marks the beginning of an analogous
ethnical revolution by which the Aryan, or Indo-European
stock intruded, in ever-increasing numbers, on the aboriginal
populations of the New World. The disparity between the
first Celtic or other Aryan immigrants into Europe and the
aborigines whom they encountered there was probably less
than that which separated the first American colonists from
the Red Indian savages whom they displaced. In both cases
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
it was the meeting of cultured races with rude nomads whom
they were prone to regard with an aversion or contempt very
different from the repellent elements between conquering and
subject nations in near equality to each other. The disparity,
for example, between the native Briton and the intruding
Saxon, or between the later Anglo-Saxon and the intruding
Dane or Northman, was sufficiently slight to admit of ready
intermixture, ultimately, in spite of their bitter antagonism.
Nor was even the civilised Roman separated by any such gulf
from the Gaul or German who bowed to the Imperial yoke,
and exchanged their independence for Roman citizenship.
But other elements have also to be kept in view. The
pioneers of emigration are not, as a rule, the most cultured
members of the intruding race; while the disparity in the
relative numbers of the sexes inevitably resulting from the
conditions under which any extensive migration takes place
forms an effective counterpoise to very wide ethnical differences.
In every case of extensive immigration, with the
excess of males and chiefly of hardy young adventurers,
the same result is inevitable. On the American continent
it has already produced a numerous race of half-breeds,
descendants of white and Indian parentage, apart from that
other and not less interesting “coloured race,” now numbering
upwards of six millions in the United States alone, the descendants
of European and African parentage. In the older
provinces of Canada, the remnants of the aboriginal Indian
tribes have been gathered on suitable reserves; and on many
of these, so far are they from hastening to extinction, that
during the last quarter of a century the returns of the Indian
Department show a steady numerical increase. In the United
States, under less favourable circumstances, similar results are
beginning to be recognised. In a report on “Indian Civilisation
and Education,” dated Washington, November 24, 1877,
it is set forth as more and more tending to assume the aspect
of an established fact, “that the Indians, instead of being
doomed to extinction within a limited period, are, as a rule,
not decreasing in numbers; and are, in all probability,
destined to form a permanent factor; an enduring element
of our population.” Wherever the aborigines have been
gathered together upon suitable reserves, and trained to
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
industrious habits, as among the Six Nation Indians, settled
on the Grand river, in the Province of Ontario; or where
they have mingled on terms of equality with the white
settlers, as within the old Hudson’s Bay territory on the
Red river, they have after a time showed indications of
endurance. It is not a mere intermingling of white and
Indian settlers, but the increase of the community by the
growth of a half-breed population; and when this takes
place under favourable circumstances, as was notably the case
so long as the hunter tribes of the prairies and the trappers
of the Hudson’s Bay Company shared the great North-West as
a common hunting-ground, the results are altogether favourable
to the endurance of the mixed race. On a nearly similar
footing we may conceive of the admixture of the earliest
Aryans with the Allophylians of Europe, resulting in some of
the most noticeable types of modern European nationalities.
The growth in the territory of the Hudson’s Bay Company of
a numerous half-breed population, assuming the status of
farming hunters, distinct alike from the Indians and the
Whites, is a fact of singular interest to the ethnologist. It
has been the result of alliances, chiefly with Indian Cree
women, by the fur trappers of the region. But these included
two distinct elements: the one a Scottish immigration, chiefly
from the Orkney Islands; the other that of the French Canadians,
who long preceded the English as hunters and trappers
in the North-West. The contrasting Scottish and French
paternity reveals itself in the hybrid offspring; but in both
cases the half-breeds are a large and robust race, with greater
powers of endurance than the pure-blood Indian. They have
been described to me by more than one trustworthy observer
as “superior in every respect, both mentally and physically,”
and this is confirmed by my own experience. The same
opinion has been expressed by nearly all who have paid special
attention to the hybrid races of the New World. D’Orbigny,
when referring to the general result of this intermingling of
races says: “Among the nations in America the product is
always superior to the two types that are mixed.” Henry, a
traveller of the last century, who spent six years among the
North American Indians, notes the confirmatory assurance
given to him by a Cristineaux chief, that “the children borne
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
by their women to Europeans were bolder warriors and better
hunters than themselves.” Finally, of the hardy race of the
Arctic circle Dr. Kane says: “The half-breeds of the coast
rival the Esquimaux in their powers of endurance.” There is
also a fine race in Greenland, half Danes; and Dr. Rae informs
me that numerous half-breed Eskimo are to be met with on
the Labrador coast. They are taller and more hardy than the
pure-blooded Eskimo; so that he always gave the preference
to them as his guides. The Danish half-breeds are described
by Dr. Henry Rink, in his <span class='it'>Tales and Traditions of the Eskimo</span>,
as dating back to the earliest times of the colonisation of
Greenland. The mixed marriages, he says, “have generally
been rich in offspring. The children for the most part grow
up as complete Greenlanders”; but the distinction between
them and the native Eskimo is unmistakable, although individuals
of the hybrid offspring represent the mixture of
European and native blood in almost every possible proportion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the conquest of Mexico in 1520, and of Peru in 1534,
this admixture of races of the Old and the New World has
been going on in varying ratio according to the relative circumstances
under which they meet. In Mexico and in the more
civilised portions of South America the half-breeds are estimated
to constitute fully one-fifth of the whole population,
while the so-called “coloured people,” the descendants of
European and African parentage, now number not less than
fifteen millions throughout the mainland and the Islands of
North and South America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the northern, southern, and western states of
America, on the Pacific slope, and in Canada, the growth of a
mixed race of White and Indian blood has everywhere taken
place in the first period of settlement, when the frontier backwoodsman
and the hunter were brought into contact with the
native tribes. Along the borders of every frontier state a
nearly exclusive male population is compelled to accept the
services of the Indian women in any attempt at domestic life.
The children grow up to share in perfect equality the rude life
of their fathers. The new generation presents a mixed race of
hardy trappers, mingling the aptitudes of both races in the wild
life of the frontier. With the increase of population, and the
more settled life of the clearing, the traces of mixed blood are
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
lost sight of; but it is to a large extent only a repetition of
what appears to have marked the advent of the Aryan immigrants
into Europe. The new, but more civilised race
predominated. Literal extermination, no doubt, did its work,
and the aborigines to a large extent perished. But no inconsiderable
remnant finally disappeared by absorption into the
general stock; not without leaving enduring evidence of the
process in the Melanochroi, or dark whites—the Iberians, or
Black Celts, as they are sometimes styled,—of Western Europe;
as well as in the allied type, not only of the Mediterranean
shores, but of Western Asia and Persia. A process has thus
been going on on the American continent for four centuries,
which cannot fail to beget new types in the future; even as a
like process is seen to have produced them under analogous
conditions in ancient Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Viewed in this aspect, the archæology and ethnology of the
New World presents in some important respects a startling
analogy to pre-Aryan Europe. Assuredly the status of the
Allophylian races of Europe can scarcely have been inferior to
that of some, at least, of the aborigines of America in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Probably the Aryan
pioneers were fully equal to its first European immigrants.
But if the ethnical characteristics of American man are simple,
and the aspect of his social life appears to realise for us a
living analogy to that of Europe’s Neolithic, if not in some
respects to that of its Palæolithic era, the question of his
antiquity acquires a new interest; for it thus becomes apparent
that man may remain through countless ages in the wild
hunter stage, as unprogressive as any other denizen of the
wilderness propagating its species and hunting for its prey.
But the whole question of the antiquity of man has undergone
a marvellous revolution. The literature of modern geology
curiously illustrates its progress, from the date of the publication
of Dean Buckland’s <span class='it'>Reliquiæ Diluvianæ</span>, in 1823, to the
final edition of Sir Charles Lyell’s <span class='it'>Principles of Geology</span>, in
1872, and the latest embodiment of his conclusions on the
special question involved in his <span class='it'>Antiquity of Man</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The determination of a Palæolithic period for Europe, with
its rude implements of flint or stone, chipped into shape
without the aid of any grinding or polishing process, and
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
belonging to an era when man was associated with animals
either extinct or known only throughout the historic period in
extreme northern latitudes, has naturally stimulated the
research of American archæologists for corresponding traces on
this continent. Nor is the anticipation of the possible recovery
of the traces of man’s presence in post-glacial, or still earlier
epochs in unhistoric areas, limited to either continent. If it
be accepted as an established fact that man has existed in
Europe for unnumbered ages, during which enormous physical
changes have been wrought; upheaval and denudation have
revolutionised the face of the continent; the deposition of the
whole drift formation has been effected; the river-valleys of
Southern England and the north of France have been excavated,
and the British Islands detached from the neighbouring
continent: it cannot be regarded as improbable that evidence
may yet be found of the early presence of man in any region
of the globe. Nevertheless some of the elements already
referred to tend to mark with a character of their own the
investigations alike of the archæologist and the geologist into
the earliest traces of human art in what we have learned
habitually to speak of as a New World. In Europe the
antiquary, familiar already with ancient historic remains, had
passed by a natural transition to the study of ruder examples
of primitive art in stone and bronze, as well as to the physical
characteristics of races which appeared to have preceeded the
earliest historic nations. The occupation of the British
Islands, for example, successively by Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons,
Danes, and Normans, was so familiar to the popular
mind that the problem of a sequence of neolithic, bronze, and
the ruder iron implements with their correlated personal
ornaments, pottery, etc., was universally solved by referring
them to Celtic, Roman, and Scandinavian art. Erroneous as
this interpretation of the evidence proves to have been, it had,
nevertheless, sufficient accordance with truth to prepare the
way for the ultimate reception of more accurate inductions.
The fact of the occurrence of successive phases of art, and
their indication of a succession of races, were undoubted; and
researches directed to the solution of the problem of European
archæology were unhesitatingly followed up through mediæval,
classical, Assyrian and Egyptian remains, to the very threshold
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
of that prehistoric dawn which forms the transitional stage
between geological and historical epochs. A significant fact,
in its bearing on the recent disclosures of the river-drift in
France and England, is that some of the most characteristic
flint implements, such as a large spear head found along with
the remains of a fossil elephant in Gray’s Inn Lane, London,
and implements of the same type obtained from the drift of
the Waveney Valley, in Surrey, underlying similar fossil
remains, had been brought under the notice of archæologists
upwards of a century before the idea of the contemporaneous
existence of man and the mammals of the Drift found any
favour; and they were unhesitatingly assigned to a Celtic
origin. The first known discovery of any flint implement in
the quaternary gravels of Europe is the one already noted
which stands recorded in the Sloane catalogue as “A British
weapon found, with elephant’s tooth, opposite to black Mary’s,
near Grayes Inn Lane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A just conception of the comprehensiveness even of
historical antiquity was long retarded in Europe by an
exclusive devotion to classical studies; but the relations of
America to the Old World are so recent, and all else is so
nearly a blank, that for it the fifteenth century is the historic
dawn, and everything dating before the landing of Columbus
has been habitually assigned to the same vague antiquity.
Hence historical research has been occupied for the most part
on very modern remains, and the supreme triumph long aimed
at has been to associate the hieroglyphics of Central America,
and the architectural monuments of Peru, with those of Egypt.
But we have entered on a new era of archæological and
historical inquiry. The palæolithic implements of the French
Drift have only been brought to light in our own day; and,
though upwards of half a century has elapsed since the
researches of Mr. J. MacEnery were rewarded by the discovery
of flint implements of the earliest type in the same
red loam of the Devonshire limestone caves which embedded
bones of the mammoth, tichorhine rhinoceros, cave-bear and
other extinct mammals, it is only recently that the full
significance of such disclosures has been recognised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>America was indeed little behind Europe in the earlier
stages of cavern research. A cabinet of the British Museum
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
is filled with fossil bones obtained by Dr. Lund and M.
Claussen from limestone caverns in Brazil, embedded in a
reddish-coloured loam, under a thick stalagmitic flooring, and
including, along with remains of genera still inhabiting the
American continent, those of extinct monkeys. Human bones
were also found in the same caves, but superficially, and
seemingly of the present Indian race. But a fresh interest
and significance have been given to such researches by the
novel aspect of prehistoric archæology in Europe. The
relations now established between the earliest traces of
European man and the geological aspects of the great Drift
formation, have naturally led to the diligent examination of
corresponding deposits of the continent of America, in the hope
of recovering similar traces there. Until recently, however,
any supposed examples of American palæolithic art have been
isolated and unsatisfactory. Colonel Charles C. Jones, in his
<span class='it'>Antiquities of the Southern Indians</span>, notes the discovery in the
Nacoochee valley, in the State of Georgia, of flint implements
from the gravel and boulders of the drift, and in material,
manner of construction, and appearance closely resembling the
rough hatchets belonging to the Drift type. Other more or
less trustworthy examples of a like kind have been reported;
among which may be noted a large specimen, now in the
collection of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, found at
Lewiston, in the State of New York, at a great depth, when
sinking a well. Implements of neolithic character, and even
of modern type, have been produced, not only from Kansas
and California gold-diggings, but from the volcanic tufa of the
Pacific coast, overlaid by repeated volcanic deposits. In a
terrace of modified drift, near Little Falls, Minnesota, an
accumulation of quartz chips have been found; the supposed
refuse of an ancient workshop. More definitely, Professor
Aughey reports the discovery of rudely chipped flint arrow heads
in the loess of the Missouri valley, beneath the bones
of the mastodon; and the loess gravels of Ohio and Indiana,
belonging unquestionably to the last glacial age, have disclosed
what seem to be genuine palæoliths, pointing to the
presence of the rational tool-maker during the close of the
quaternary epoch of the North American continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of those assumed illustrations of American palæolithic
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
art cannot be accepted. One implement, for example, from
the Californian gravel-drift, is a polished stone plummet perforated
at one end, and not only modern in character, but as
a genuine discovery in the gold-bearing gravels, tending to
discredit the palæolithic origin assigned to ruder implements
found under similar circumstances. But the most startling
examples of this class are of minor importance when compared
with reported discoveries of human remains in the Californian
drift. In 1857, Dr. C. F. Winslow produced a fragment of
a human skull found eighteen feet below the surface in the
“pay drift” at Table Mountain, associated with remains of
the mastodon and fossil elephant. From beds underlying
the lava and volcanic tufa of California, from time to time
other evidences of the assumed ancient presence of man
and traces of his art are produced. But the manifestly recent
character of some of the latter prove the disturbance of these
deposits by subsequent influences. In 1869 Professor J. D.
Whitney exhibited, at the Chicago meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, a complete human
skull, recovered at a depth of 130 feet in the auriferous gravel
of Calaveras County, California, underlying five successive beds
of lava and volcanic tufa, and vouched for its geological
antiquity. The gravel which adhered to the relic found
imbedded in it is referred by him to the Pliocene age; and
Dr. J. W. Foster remarks of it, in his <span class='it'>Prehistoric Races of the
United States</span>: “This skull, admitting its authenticity,
carries back the advent of man to the Pliocene epoch, and is
therefore older than the stone implements of the drift-gravel of
Abbeville and Amiens, or the relics furnished by the cave-dirt
of Belgium and France.” In reality, however, the authenticity
of the skull as a pliocene relic cannot be admitted. Like
that of Guadaloupe, those found by Dr. Lund in the Brazil
caves, and other fossil skulls of the American continent, it
proved, according to the trustworthy report of Dr. Wyman, to
be of the ordinary Indian type; though to some minds that
only confirms the genuineness of the discovery. A human
skull recovered from the delta of the Mississippi at New
Orleans, and estimated by Dr. Dowler—on what, “to avoid all
cavil,” he claimed to be extremely moderate assumptions,—as
not less than 57,000 years old, is grouped with others found
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
by Dr. Lund in one of the Brazil caves, at Logoa Santa, and
thus commented on: “Numerous species of animals have been
blotted from creation since American humanity’s first appearance.
The form of these crania, moreover, proves that the
general type of races inhabiting America at that inconceivably
remote era was the same which prevailed at the Columbian
discovery”;<a id='r42'/><a href='#f42' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[42]</span></sup></a> and so the authors of <span class='it'>Types of Mankind</span> arrived
at the conclusion that with such evidence of the native
American type having occupied the continent in geological
times, before the formation of the Mississippi alluvia, science
may spare itself the trouble of looking elsewhere for the origin
of the American race! The high authority of Professor
Agassiz was adduced at the time in support of this and other
equally crude assumptions; but they have ceased to receive
the countenance of men of science.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the progress of European discovery has familiarised
us with the idea of the rude primeval race of its Palæolithic
era, so designated in reference to their characteristic implements
recovered from the river-drift of France and England, and from
the sedimentary accumulations of their rock shelters and limestone
caves. That flint and stone implements of every variety
of form abound in the soil of the New World, has been
established by ample proof; and if mere rudeness could be
accepted as evidence of antiquity, many of them rival in this
respect the rudest implements of the European drift. But it
has to be kept in view that the indigenous tribes of America
have scarcely even now abandoned the manufacture of implements
of obsidian, flint, and stone, or of bone and ivory. So
striking, indeed, is the analogy between the simple arts of
the palæolithic cave-men of Southern France, and those still
practised by the Eskimo, that Professor Boyd Dawkins inferred
from this conclusive evidence of a pedigree for the Arctic
aborigines little less ancient than that which Dr. Dowler long
ago deduced from his discovery in the delta of the Mississippi.
The implements and accumulated debris of the ancient hunters
of the Garonne, the contemporaries of the mammoth and other
extinct mammals, and of the reindeer, musk-sheep, cave-bear,
and other species known only within the historic period in
extreme northern latitudes, undoubtedly suggest interesting
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
analogies with the modern Eskimo. Only under similar climatic
conditions to those in which they now live, could such accumulations
of animal remains as have been found in the caves
of the valley of the Vésère be possible in places habitually
resorted to by man. But such analogies form a very slender
basis on which to found the hypothesis that the race of the
Mammoth and Reindeer period in the remote Post-Pliocene era
of Southern France has its living representatives within the
Arctic circle of the American continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The students of modern archæology have become familiar
with startling disclosures; and the supposed identification of
living representatives of the race of the pleistocene river beds
or cave deposits is too fascinating a one to be readily abandoned
by its originator. The men of the River-Drift era are assumed
to have been a race of still older and ruder savages than the
palæolithic cave-men, who were more restricted in their range,
and considerably in advance of them in the variety and
workmanship of their weapons and implements. The elder
ruder race has vanished; but the cave-race of that indefinite
but vastly remote era of pliocene, or post-pliocene Europe,
is imagined to still survive within the Arctic frontiers of
Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In discussing the plausible hypothesis which thus aims
at recovering in the hyperboreans of America the race that
before the close of Europe’s Pleistocene age, hunted the
mammoth, the musk-sheep, and the reindeer in the valleys of
the Garonne, Professor Dawkins reviewed the manners and
habits of the Eskimo as a race of hunters, fishers, and fowlers,
accumulating round their dwellings vast refuse heaps similar
to those of the ancient cave-men. Both were ignorant of the
metallurgic arts, were excluded to a large extent by a like
rigorous climate from access to stone or flint; while they
habitually turned to account the available material, resulting
from the spoils of the chase: bone, ivory, and deer’s horn, in
the manufacture of all needful tools. The implements and
weapons thus common to both do unquestionably prove that
their manner of life was in many respects similar. Professor
Dawkins also notes, what can scarcely seem surprising in any
people familiar with the working in bone, namely, the use at times
by the Eskimo of fossil mammoth ivory for the handles of their
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
stone scrapers, and adds: “It is very possible that this habit
of the Eskimos may have been handed down from the late
pleistocene times.” But what strikes him as “the most
astonishing bond of union between the cave-men and the
Eskimo is the art of representing animals”; and, after noting
those familiar to both, along with the correspondence in their
weapons, and habits as hunters, he says: “All these points of
connection between the cave-men and the Eskimos can, in my
opinion, be explained only on the hypothesis that they belong
to the same race.”<a id='r43'/><a href='#f43' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[43]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the ingenious imitative art of the Cro-Magnon cave-dwellers,
it is by no means peculiar to them and the modern
Eskimo; but, on the contrary, is common to many savage
races; though by no modern savage people has a like degree of
artistic ability been shown. Professor Dawkins says truly of
the cave-man: “He possessed a singular talent for representing
the animals he hunted; and his sketches reveal to us that he
had a capacity for seeing the beauty and grace of natural form
not much inferior to that which is the result of long-continued
civilisation in ourselves, and very much higher than that of his
successors in Europe in the Neolithic age. The hunter who
was both artist and sculptor, who reproduced, with his imperfect
means, at one time foliage, at another the quiet repose
of a reindeer feeding, has left behind him the proof of a decided
advance in culture, such as might be expected to result from
the long continuance of man on the earth in the hunter state
of civilisation.”<a id='r44'/><a href='#f44' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[44]</span></sup></a> All this is correct in reference to the art of
the Vézère carvers and draughtsmen; but it would be gross
exaggeration if applied to such conventional art as the Eskimo
arrow-straightener which Professor Dawkins figures, with its
formal row of reindeer and their grotesque accessories. The
same criticism is equally applicable to numerous other
specimens of Eskimo art, and to similar Innuit, or western
Eskimo representations of hunting scenes, such as those figured
by Mr. William H. Dall, in his <span class='it'>Alaska</span>, which he describes as
“drawings analogous to those discovered in France in the caves
of Dordogne.”<a id='r45'/><a href='#f45' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[45]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The identity, or near resemblance between harpoons, fowling
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
spears, marrow spoons, and scrapers, of the ancient cave-race
of pleistocene France, and implements of the modern
Eskimo, is full of interest; as is much also of a like kind
between savage races of our own day in the most widely
severed regions of the globe; but it is a slender basis on which
to found such far-reaching deductions. The old race that lived
on the verge of the great glaciers in Southern France gave the
preference to bone and ivory over flint or stone, because the
climatic conditions under which they lived rendered those
most accessible to them; and we see in the familiar types of
flint arrow heads, stone hammers, and the like primitive tools
of savage man, both in ancient and modern times, how
naturally the workman, with the same materials and similar
necessities, shapes his few and simple weapons and implements
into like form. As to the absence of pottery, alike
among the ancient cave-dwellers and the modern Eskimo,
in which another element of resemblance is traced, it proves
no more than that both had to work under climatic conditions
which rendered clay, adequate fuel, and nearly all
other appliances of the potter, even less available than flint
and stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the caves of the Vézère have furnished examples not only
of skulls, but of complete skeletons of an ancient race of cave-dwellers,
whether that of the ingenious draughtsmen and reindeer
hunters or not; and had those, or the underlying debris,
yielded traces of the Eskimo type of head, there would then be
good reason for attaching an exceptional value to any evidence
of correspondence in arts and habits. But the cerebral
capacity of this Cro-Magnon race amply accords with the
artistic skill, and the sense of beauty and grace of natural form,
ascribed to the ancient draughtsmen; and their well-developed
skulls and large bones present the most striking contrast
to the stunted Eskimo. The strongly marked physiognomy of
the former bears no resemblance to the debased Mongolian type
of the latter. No doubt it may be argued with sufficient plausibility
that in the slow retreat of the palæolithic race, whether
eastward by the river-valleys of Europe, and across the steppes
of Asia, to Behring Strait; or over submerging continents, since
engulfed in the ocean; and in the vast æons of their retreat
to their latest home in another hemisphere, on the verge of the
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
pole, any amount of change may have modified the physical
characteristics of the race. But if so, the evidence of their
pedigree is no longer producible. The Eskimo may be related
by descent to the men of the French Reindeer period, as we
ourselves may be descendants of palæolithic man; but, as Professor
Geikie has justly remarked: “When anthropologists
produce from some of the caves occupied by the reindeer
hunters a cranium resembling that of the living Eskimo, it will
be time enough to admit that the latter has descended from the
former. But, unfortunately for the view here referred to, none
of the skulls hitherto found affords it any support.”<a id='r46'/><a href='#f46' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[46]</span></sup></a> In
truth, the plausible fancy that the discoveries of the last
twenty-five years have tended to confirm the identification of
the cave-men with the Eskimo, only requires the full appreciation
of all that it involves, in order that it shall take its place
with that other identification with the red man of the present
day of “Dr. Dowler’s sub-cypress Indian who dwelt on the
site of New Orleans 57,000 years ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The received interpretation of the imperfect record which
remains to us of the successive eras of geological change with
the accompanying modifications of animal life, down to the
appearance of man, and the deciphering of geological
chroniclings as a coherent disclosure of the past history of the
earth, are largely due to Sir Charles Lyell. In 1841 he
visited America, and then estimated with cautious conservatism
some of the evidences adduced for the assumed antiquity of
American man. But subsequent observations led him to
modify his views; and at length, in 1863, he “read his recantation”
of earlier opinions; and—so far at least as Europe is
concerned,—gave the full weight of his authority to the conclusions
relative to the antiquity of man based on the discovery
of flint implements associated with bones of extinct mammalia
at Abbeville and in the valley of the Thames. The peculiar
geological conditions accompanying the earliest evidence of the
presence of palæolithic man in Europe proved, when rightly
interpreted, to be no less convincing than the long-familiar
sequence of more recent archæological indices by which antiquarian
speculation has proceeded step by step back towards
that prehistoric dawn in which geology and archæology meet
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
on common ground. The chalk and the overlying river-drift,
abounding with flint nodules, left no room for question as to
the source of the raw material from which the primitive implements
were manufactured. The flint is still abundant as ever,
in nodules of a size amply sufficient for furnishing the largest
palæoliths, in the localities both of France and England
where such specimens of primitive art have been recovered
by thousands. But there also other disclosures tell no less
conclusively of many subsequent stages of progress, alike in
prehistoric and historic times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir John Evans, in his <span class='it'>Ancient Stone Implements of Great
Britain</span>, purposely begins with the more recent implements,
including those of the Australian and other modern savage
races, and traces his way backward, “ascending the stream of
time,” and noting the diverse examples of ingeniously fashioned
and polished tools of the Neolithic age which preceded that
palæolithic class, of vast antiquity and rudest workmanship,
which now constitute the earliest known works of man; if they
are not, indeed, examples of the first infantile efforts of human
skill. But alike in Britain, and on the neighbouring continent,
a chronological sequence of implements in stone and metal,
with pottery, personal ornaments, and other illustrations of progressive
art, supplies the evidence by means of which we are
led backward—not without some prolonged interruptions, as
we approach the Palæolithic age,—from historic to the remotest
prehistoric times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The relative chronology of the European drift may be thus
stated: first, and most modern, the superficial deposits of
recent centuries with their mediæval traces of Frank and Gaul;
and along with those, the tombs, the pottery, and other remains
of the Roman period, scarcely perceptibly affected in their
geological relations by nearly the whole interval of the Christian
era; next, in the alluvium, seemingly embedded by
natural accumulation at an average depth of fifteen feet, occur
remains of a European Stone period, corresponding in many
respects to those of the pfahlbauten, or pile villages of the
Swiss Lakes; and, underlying such accumulations exceeding
in their duration the whole historical period, we come at length
to the tool-bearing drift, imbedding, along with the fossil
remains of many extinct mammals, the implements of palæolithic
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
man, fashioned seemingly when the rivers were only beginning
the work of excavating the valleys which give their present
contour to the landscapes of France and England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, as elsewhere, we recognise progression from the most
artless rudeness of tool manufacture, belonging to an epoch
when the process of grinding flint or stone to an edge appears
to have been unknown; through various stages of the primitive
worker in stone, bone, ivory, and the like natural products;
and then the discovery and gradual development of the
metallurgic arts. Yet at the same time it must not be lost
sight of that mere rudeness of workmanship is no evidence of
antiquity. Nothing can well be conceived of more artless
than some of the stone implements still in use among savage
tribes of America. Moreover, it is to be noted that it is not
amid the privations of an Arctic winter, with its analogies so
suggestive of a condition of life corresponding to that of the
men of Europe’s Palæolithic age, but in southern latitudes,
with a climate which furnishes abundant resources for savage
man, that the crudest efforts at tool-making now occur. In a
report of the <span class='it'>United States Geological Survey</span> for 1872,
Professor Joseph Leidy furnishes an interesting account of
numerous implements, rude as any in the Drift, observed by
him while engaged on a survey at the base of the Unitah
Mountains in Southern Wyoming. “In some places,” he
remarks, “the stone implements are so numerous, and at the
same time are so rudely constructed, that one is constantly in
doubt when to consider them as natural or accidental, and
when to view them as artificial.”<a id='r47'/><a href='#f47' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[47]</span></sup></a> But with these, others are
mingled of fine finish. The Shoshones who haunt the region
seem to be incapable of such skill as the latter imply; and
express the belief that they were a gift of the Great Spirit to
their ancestors. Yet many are fresh in appearance; though
others are worn and decomposed on the surface, and may, as
Professor Leidy assumes, have lain there for centuries. The
tendency is now, even among experienced archæologists, to
assume that they are actually palæolithic. Mr. Thomas
Wilson remarks, in his <span class='it'>Report</span> of 1887: “Dr. Leidy did not
know these implements to be what they really were, that is
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
implements of the Palæolithic period.”<a id='r48'/><a href='#f48' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[48]</span></sup></a> But in view of Dr.
Leidy’s whole narrative, his assumption seems to be more consistent
with the observed data. In the same narrative he
describes a stone scraper, or <span class='it'>teshoa</span>, as the Shoshones call it,
employed by them in the dressing of buffalo-skins, but of so
simple a character that he says, “had I not observed it in
actual use, and had noticed it among the materials of the
buttes, or horizontal strata of indurated clays and sandstone,
I would have viewed it as an accidental spawl.” When
illustrating the characteristics of a like class of stone implements
and weapons of Great Britain, Sir John Evans figures and
describes an axe, or war-club, procured from the Indians of
Rio Frio in Texas. Its blade is a piece of trachyte, so rudely
chipped that it would scarcely attract attention as of artificial
working, but for the club-like haft, evidently chopped into
shape with stone tools, into which it is inserted. Nothing
ruder has been brought to light in any drift or cave deposit.<a id='r49'/><a href='#f49' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[49]</span></sup></a>
Another modern Texas implement, in the Smithonnia collections
at Washington,<a id='r50'/><a href='#f50' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[50]</span></sup></a> is a rudely-fashioned flint blade,
presenting considerable resemblance to a familiar class of oval
implements of the river-drift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far, therefore, as unskilled art and the mere rudeness of
workmanship are concerned, it might be assumed that the
aborigines of America are thus presented to our study in their
most primitive stage. They had advanced in no degree beyond
the condition of the European savage of the River-Drift period,
when, at the close of the fifteenth century, they were brought
into contact with modern European culture; and nothing in
their rude arts seemed to offer a clue to their origin, or any
evidence of progression. So far as anything could be learned
from their work, they might have entered on the occupation
of the northern continent, subsequent to the visits of the
Northmen in the tenth century; and, indeed, American
archæologists generally favour the opinion that the <span class='it'>Skrælings</span>,
as the Northmen designated the New England natives whom
they encountered, were not Red Indians but Eskimo. But
whatever may have been the local distribution of races at that
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
date, geological evidence, which has proved so conclusive in
relation to European ethnology, has at length been appealed to
by American investigators, with results which seem to establish
for their continent also its primeval Stone period, and remote
prehistoric dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Report of the Peabody Museum of American Archæology
and Ethnology</span> for 1877, gave the first publicity to a communication
from Dr. Charles C. Abbott, setting forth the data from
which he was led to assume that man existed on the American
continent during the formation of the great glacial deposit
which extends from Labrador as far south as Virginia. The
scene of his successful research is in the valley of the Delaware,
near Trenton, New Jersey. Though the relative antiquity of
the Trenton gravel beds is modern compared with some subsequent
disclosures, his discoveries have a special interest as
foremost among those of implement-bearing gravels in the
New World. In the gravel, deposited by the Delaware river
in the process of excavating the valley through which its
course now lies, Dr. Abbott’s diligent search has been rewarded
by finding numerous specimens of rudely chipped implements
of a peculiar type, to which he has given the name of “turtle-back
celts.” They are fashioned of a highly indurated argillite,
with a conchoidal fracture, and have been recovered at depths
varying from five to upwards of twenty feet below the overlying
soil, in the undisturbed gravel of the bluff facing the
Delaware river, as well as in railway cuttings and other
excavations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, to all appearance, intelligent research had at length
been rewarded by the discovery of undoubted traces of the
American palæolithic man; and Dr. Abbott, not unnaturally,
gave free scope to his fancy, as he realised to himself the preoccupation
of the river valley with “the village sites of pre-glacial
man.” There is a fascination in such disclosures which,
especially in the case of the original discoverer, tempts to
extreme views; and both in France and England, at the present
time, the more eager among the geologists and archæologists
devoted to this inquiry are reluctantly restrained from assuming
as a scientific fact the existence of man in Southern
England and in France under more genial climatic influences,
prior to the great Ice age which wrought such enormous
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
changes there. The theory which Dr. Abbott formed on the
basis of the evidence first presented to him by the disclosures
of the Trenton gravel may be thus stated. Towards the close
of the great Ice age, the locality which has rewarded his search
for specimens of palæolithic art marked the termination of the
glacier on the Atlantic coast. Here, at the foot of the glacier,
a primitive people, in a condition closely analogous to that
of the Eskimo of the present day, made their home, and
wandered over the open sea in the vicinity, during the
accumulation of the deposit from the melting glacier. But
this drift-gravel was modified by subsequent action. According
to Dr. Abbott’s conclusions, it was deposited in open
water, on the bed of a shallow sea. But the position of the
large boulders, and the absence of true clay in the mass, suggest
that it has undergone great changes since its original
deposition as glacial debris; and if this is to be accounted for
by subsequent action of water, the unpolished surfaces of the
chipped implements are inconsistent with such a theory of
their origin. Huge boulders, of the same character as those
which abound in the underlying gravel, occur on the surface;
and their presence there was referred to by Dr. Abbott as
throwing light upon “the occurrence of rude implements
identical with those found in the underlying gravels, inasmuch
as the same ice-raft that bore the one, with its accompanying
sand and gravel, might well gather up also stray relics of this
primitive people, and re-deposit them where they are now
found.” Accordingly, seeking in fancy to recall this ancient
past, he says in his first report: “In times preceding the
formation of this gravel bed, now in part facing the Delaware
river, there were doubtless localities, once the village sites of pre-glacial
man, where these rude stone implements would necessarily
be abundant,” and he accordingly asks “May not the ice
in its onward march, gathering in bulk every loose fragment
of rock and particle of soil, have held them loosely together,
and, hundreds of miles from their original site, left them in
some one locality such as this, where the river has again
brought to light rude implements that characterise an almost
primitive people? But, assuming that the various implements
fashioned by a strictly pre-glacial people have been totally
destroyed by the crushing forces of the glacier, and that the
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
specimens now produced were not brought from a distance,
may they not be referred to an early race that, driven southward
by the encroaching ice, dwelt at the foot of the glacier, and
during their sojourn here these implements were lost?”<a id='r51'/><a href='#f51' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[51]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The opinions thus set forth in the first published account
of Dr. Abbott’s discoveries, have since been considerably
modified, in so far as the geological age of the tool-bearing
gravel of the Delaware valley is concerned. In his earlier
publications he assumed, as no longer questionable, the existence
of inter-glacial, if not pre-glacial, man on the continent.
In his more matured views, as set forth in his <span class='it'>Primitive
Industry</span>, he speaks of “having been seriously misled by the
various geological reports that purport to give, in proper
sequence, the respective ages of the several strata of clay,
gravel, boulders, and sand, through which the river has finally
worn its channel to the ocean level”;<a id='r52'/><a href='#f52' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[52]</span></sup></a> so that he has probably
ascribed too great an antiquity to the peculiar class of stone
implements brought to light in the river-gravels of New Jersey.
Dr. Abbott, accordingly, states as his more matured conclusion,
confirmed by the reports of some of the most experienced
geological observers, on whose judgment he relies, that the
Trenton gravel, in which alone the turtle-back celts have thus
far been found, is a post-glacial river deposit, made at a time
when the river was larger than at present; and is the most
recent of all the formations of the Delaware.<a id='r53'/><a href='#f53' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[53]</span></sup></a> Here, however,
the term “recent” is employed altogether relatively; and
although Dr. Abbott no longer claims in the discovery of the
stone implements of the gravel beds near Trenton, New Jersey,
evidence of the existence of man on the American continent
before the close of the Glacial period, he still refers the Trenton
gravel tool-makers to an era which, at the lowest computation,
precedes by thousands of years the earliest historical glimpses
of Assyria, Egypt, or wherever among the most ancient nations
of the Old World the beginnings of history can be traced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The disclosures of Dr. Abbott claim a special importance
among the fruits of archæological investigation on the American
continent, not only from the fact that they furnish the first
well-authenticated results of systematic research based on the
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
scientific analogies of European archæology, but these later
results have included the remains of man himself. When Dr.
Usher of Mobile contributed to <span class='it'>The Types of Mankind</span> an
account of the discovery of a human skeleton at New Orleans,
found under circumstances from which the existence of man in
the delta of the Mississippi was deduced well nigh sixty
thousand years ago, it was scarcely calculated to win the
reader’s acceptance of that assumption when it was added that
“the type of the cranium was, as might have been expected,
that of the aboriginal American race.” Nor is this the only
example of skull of a strictly modern Indian type from which
the inference has been drawn that the same unchanging
form has prevailed from the era of pre-glacial American man
till now. Three human crania found in the Trenton gravel
are now in the Peabody Museum at Cambridge (Harvard).
All are of the same type, but it differs essentially from that
of the Red Indian skull. They are of small size, oval, and
present a striking contrast to all other skulls in the Peabody
collection. Their value is due to the fact of their discovery
in the implement-bearing gravel, in proximity to the characteristic
examples of what are assumed to be palæolithic celts.
For it is well for us to bear in remembrance that the evidences
of the antiquity of man in Europe do not rest on any number
of chance disclosures. It is a simple procedure to dig into a
Celtic or Saxon barrow, and find there the implements and
pottery of its builders lying alongside of their buried remains.
But archæologists have learned to recognise the palæolithic
implements as not less characteristic of certain post-pliocene
deposits than the palæontology of the same geological formation.
The river-drift and cave deposits are characterised by traces of
contemporaneous life, as shown in the examples of primitive
art from which they receive the name of the tool-bearing drift
or gravel; just as older geological formations have their characteristic
animal and vegetable fossils. The specific character
of the tool-bearing gravel of the French Drift having been
determined, geologists and archæologists have sought for flint
implements in corresponding English strata, as they would
seek for the fossils of the same period, and with like success.
Palæolithic implements have been recovered in this manner in
Suffolk, Bedford, Hartford, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey, and other
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
districts in the south of England. So entirely indeed has the
man of the Drift passed beyond the province of the archæologist,
that in 1861 Professor Prestwich followed up his
<span class='it'>Notes on Further Discoveries of Flint Implements in Beds of
Post-Pleiocene Gravel and Clay</span>, with a list of forty-one localities
where gravel and clay pits or gravel beds occur, as some of
the places in the south of England where he thought flint
implements might also by diligent search possibly be found;
and subsequent discoveries confirmed his anticipations. It
has been by the application of the same principle to the drift
and river-valley gravels of the New World that a like success
has been achieved. The result of a careful study of the tool-bearing
gravel of the Delaware may be thus summarised from
recent reports of trustworthy scientific observers. The Trenton
gravel is a post-glacial river deposit, made at a time when the
river was larger than its present volume. It represents apparently
the latest of the surface deposits of the upper Delaware
valley;<a id='r54'/><a href='#f54' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[54]</span></sup></a> and Dr. Abbott remarks of it: “The melting of
a local glacier in the Cattskill Mountains would probably
result, at the headwaters of the Delaware, in a continued
flood of sufficient volume, if supplemented by the action of
floating ice, to form the Trenton gravels.”<a id='r55'/><a href='#f55' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[55]</span></sup></a> But these gravels
are now recognised as the youngest of the series of ancient
implement-bearing deposits. Underneath lies the older Columbia
gravel, which has also yielded—though in much fewer
numbers,—palæoliths of primitive types. The researches of
Mr. Hilborne T. Cresson in the State of Delaware have already
been referred to; and from those results, as well as from
similar disclosures in Ohio and Indiana, it is no longer doubted
that reliable traces have been recovered of American man
contemporary with the mammoth and the mastodon; and—like
the old cave-dwellers of Cro-Magnon,—a hunter of the
reindeer in the valley of the Delaware.</p>

<p class='pindent'>American archæologists have undoubtedly been repeatedly
deceived by the misleading traces of comparatively modern
remains in deposits of some geological antiquity; as in instances
already referred to in the California gravel beds.
In these, indeed, ground and polished instruments of stone,
including a “plummet” of highly polished syenite, “an
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
exhibition of the lapidary’s skill superior to anything yet furnished
by the Stone age of either continent,”<a id='r56'/><a href='#f56' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[56]</span></sup></a> are produced
from time to time from the same post-pliocene formation
where the remains of the elephant and mastodon abound. Dr.
Abbott did not overlook the danger to which the archæologist
is thus exposed on a continent which, so far as its aborigines
are concerned, has scarcely yet emerged from its Stone age.
He accordingly remarked in his original report: “The chance
occurrence of single specimens of the ordinary forms of Indian
relics, at depths somewhat greater than they have usually
reached, even in constantly cultivated soils, induced me,
several years since, to carefully examine the underlying
gravels, to determine if the common surface-found stone
implements of Indian origin were ever found therein, except
in such manner as might easily be explained, as in the case
of deep burials by the uprooting of large trees, whereby an
implement lying on the surface, or immediately below it,
might fall into the gravel beneath, and subsequently become
buried several feet in depth; and lastly, by the action of the
water, as where a spring, swollen by spring freshets, cuts for
itself a new channel, and carrying away a large body of earth,
leaves its larger pebbles, and possibly stone implements of late
origin, upon the gravel of the new bed of the stream.” But
there is little difficulty in separating chance-buried neolithic
or modern implements from the genuine palæolithic celts or
hatchets abundantly present in the undisturbed gravel beds,
from which they have been taken on their first exposure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Henry C. Lewis, of the Pennsylvania Geological
Survey, states that “at the localities on the Pennsylvania
Railroad, where extensive exposures of these gravels have been
made, the deposit is undoubtedly undisturbed. No implement
could have come into this gravel except at a time when the
river flowed upon it, and when they might have sunk through
the loose and shifting material. All the evidence points to
the conclusion that at the time of the Trenton gravel flood,
Man, in a rude state, with habits similar to those of the river-drift
hunter of Europe, and probably under a climate similar
to that of more northern regions, lived upon the banks of the
ancient Delaware, and lost his stone implements in the shifting
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
sands and gravel of the bed of that stream.”<a id='r57'/><a href='#f57' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[57]</span></sup></a> To this
Dr. Abbott adds: “At just such a locality as Trenton, where
the river widens out, traces of man, had he existed during the
accumulation of the gravel, would be most likely to occur.
This is true not only because there is here the greatest mass
of the gravel, and the best opportunities for examining it in
section, but the locality would be one most favourable for the
existence of man at the time. The higher ground in the
immediate vicinity was sufficiently elevated to be free from
the encroachments of the ice and water, and the climate, soil,
and fauna are all such as to make it possible for man to exist
at this time in this locality.”<a id='r58'/><a href='#f58' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[58]</span></sup></a> In 1878 the tusk of a
mastodon was found under partially stratified gravel at a
depth of fourteen feet; and Dr. Abbott states that, within a
few yards of this, palæolithic implements have been gathered,
one at the same and three at greater depths. Now that an
intelligent interest has been awakened in the subject, numerous
labourers are enlisted in its elucidation. To this a coherent
unity has been given by the archæologists of the Peabody
Museum at Harvard, and the curators of the National Museum
at Washington. The results of a systematic inquiry by the
latter into the localities and numbers of examples of supposed
palæolithic works of art already recovered, have disclosed
abundant confirmatory evidence. Special attention was invited
to the occurrence of surface-finds, as well as to the depth and
the geological indications of age in those recovered from
excavations or chance exposures under the surface. Of the
superficial examples the proof of the occurrence of stone
implements of palæolithic types over widely diffused areas,
from New England to Texas, is abundant. Much caution is
required in the conclusions derived from such implements found
exposed, or in superficial deposits, on a continent where weapons
and implements of stone are still in frequent use. But
after the elimination of all doubtful examples, abundant evidence
remains of the presence of man on the American continent
in a Palæolithic as well as an early Neolithic age. An
interesting <span class='it'>résumé</span> of recent evidence is embodied in the
“Results of an Inquiry as to the Existence of Man in North
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
America during the Palæolithic Period of the Stone Age,” by
Mr. Thomas Wilson of the National Museum at Washington.<a id='r59'/><a href='#f59' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[59]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>It may still be a question whether the Palæolithic age of
the New World is equally remote with that of the eastern
hemisphere. The date approximately assigned thus far to the
American Palæolithic era is, geologically speaking, recent;
and on that very account adapts itself to other favoured
assumptions, such as the supposed Eskimo pedigree derived
from the race of Europe’s Reindeer period. This chimes in
with the old idea of the American antiquary that the <span class='it'>Skrælings</span>
referred to in the Eric Saga were Eskimo, as is far from
improbable, though the assumption rests on no definite evidence.
Dr. Abbott accordingly reproduces the statement of
Professor Dawkins, in confirmation of the revived belief.
“We are without a clue to the ethnology of the river-drift
man, who most probably is as completely extinct at the
present time as the woolly rhinoceros or the cave-bear; but
the discoveries of the last twenty years have tended to confirm
the identification of the cave-man with the Eskimo.”
Such a fanciful hypothesis once accepted as fact, its application
to American ethnology is easy; and so Dr. Abbott proceeds
to appeal unhesitatingly to evidence sufficient “to warrant the
assertion that the palæolithic man on the one hand, and the
makers of the argillite spear points on the other, stand in the
relationship of ancestor and descendant; and if the latter, as
is probable, is in turn the ancestor of the modern Eskimo:
then does it not follow that the River-drift and Cave-man of
Europe, supposing the relationship of the latter to the Eskimo
to be correct, bear the same close relationship to each other
as do the American representatives of these earliest of
people?”<a id='r60'/><a href='#f60' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[60]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Such an appeal to European archæology can scarcely fail to
suggest some very striking contrasts thereby involved. As the
thoughtful student dwells on all the phenomena of change and
geological revolution which he has to encounter in seeking to
assign to the man of the European Drift his place in vanished
centuries, his mind is lost in amazement at the vista of that
long-forgotten past. Yet inadequate as the intermediate steps
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
may appear, there are progressive stages. Amid all the overwhelming
sense of the vastness of the period embraced in the
changes which he reviews, the mind rests from time to time
at well-defined stations, in tracking the way backward, through
ages of historical antiquity, into the night of time, and so to
that dim dawn of mechanical skill and rational industry in
which the first tool-makers plied their ingenious arts. But, so
far as yet appears, it is wholly otherwise throughout the whole
western continent, from the Gulf of Mexico northward to the
pole. North America has indeed a Copper age of its own very
markedly defined; for the shores and islands of Lake Superior
are rich in pure native copper, available for industrial resources
without even the most rudimentary knowledge of metallurgic
arts. But the tools and personal ornaments fashioned out of
this more workable material are little, if at all, in advance of
the implements of stone; and, with this exception, the primitive
industry of North America manifests wondrously slight traces
of progression through all the ages now assigned to man’s
presence on the continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The means available for forming some just estimate of the
character of native American art are now abundant. In the
National Museum at Washington; the Peabody Museum at
Cambridge, Mass.; the Peabody Academy at Salem; the
Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia; the American
Antiquarian Society at Worcester, Mass.; and in various
Historical Societies and University Museums throughout the
States; the student of American archæology has the means of
obtaining a comprehensive view of the native arts. At the
Centennial Exposition of Philadelphia in 1876, the various
States vied with one another in producing an adequate representation
of the antiquities specially characteristic of their own
localities; and numerous valuable reports, of the Smithsonian
Institution, the United States Geographical Surveys, the
Geological Survey of Canada, and the Geological Surveys of
various States, have furnished data for determining the prehistoric
chroniclings of the northern continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the latest publications of this class is Dr. Abbott’s
own volume, entitled <span class='it'>Primitive Industry: or Illustrations of
the Handiwork in Stone, Bone, and Clay of the native Races of the
Northern Atlantic Seaboard of America</span>. It is a most instructive
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
epitome of North American archæology. Notwithstanding
the limits set in the title, works in metal as well as in stone
are included; and what are the results? Twenty-one out of
its twenty-three chapters are devoted to the detailed illustrations
of stone and flint axes, celts, hammers, chisels, scrapers,
drills, knives, etc. Fish-hooks, fish-spears, awls or bodkins, and
other implements of bone, pottery, pipes both in stone and clay,
and personal ornaments, receive the like detailed illustration;
but nearly all are in the rudest stage of rudimentary art. An
advance upon this is seen in the pottery of some southern
states. That of the Mound-Builders appears to have shown
both more artistic design and better finish. The carving in
bone, ivory, and slate-stone of various western tribes, as well
as of the extinct Mound-Builders, was also of a higher character.
But taking them at their highest, they cannot compare in
practical skill or variety of application with the industrial arts
of Europe’s Neolithic age; and we look in vain for any traces
of higher progress. For well nigh four centuries, this continent
has been familiar to European explorers and settlers. During
some considerable portion of that time, by means of agricultural
operations, and all the incidents consequent on urban settlement,
its virgin soil has been turned up over ever-increasing
areas. For nearly forty years I have myself watched, with the
curious interest of one previously familiar with the minute
incidents of archæological research in Britain, the urban
excavations, railway cuttings, and other undesigned explorations
of Canadian soil. Within the same period, both in
Canada and the United States, extensive canal, railway, and
road-works have afforded abundant opportunities for research;
and a widespread interest in American antiquities has tended
to confer an even exaggerated importance on every novel discovery.
And with what result? Dr. Abbott, in crowning
such explorations with his interesting and valuable discovery
of the turtle-back celts and other implements of the Delaware
gravel, has epitomised the prehistoric record of the northern
continent. The further back we date the presence of man in
America, the more marvellous must his unprogressive condition
appear. Whatever may be the ampler disclosures relative
to the palæolithic or primeval race, it does not seem probable
that this northern continent will now yield any antiquities
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
suggestive of an extinct era of native art and civilisation.
Here we cannot hope to find a buried Ilium, or Tadmor in the
Wilderness. Everywhere the explorer wanders, and the agriculturist
follows, turning up the soil, or digging deeper as he
drains and builds; but only to disturb the grave of the savage
hunter. The Mound-Builders of its great river-valleys have
indeed left there their enduring earthworks, wrought at times
in regular geometrical configuration on a gigantic scale, strangely
suggestive of some overruling and informing mind guiding the
hand of the earthworker. But their mounds and earthworks
disclose only implements of bone and flint or stone, with here
and there an equally rude tool of hammered native copper.
The crudest metallurgy of Europe’s Copper age was unknown
to their builders. The art of Tubal-cain, the primitive worker
in brass and iron, had not dawned on the mind of any native
artificer. Only the ingeniously carved tobacco pipe, or the
better-fashioned pottery, gives the slightest hint of even such
progress beyond the first infantile stage of the tool-maker as
is shown in the artistic carvings of the cave-men contemporary
with the mammoth and the reindeer of post-glacial France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The civilisation of Central and Southern America is a
wholly distinct thing; and, as I think, not without some
suggestive traces of Asiatic origin; but the attempts to connect
it with that of ancient Egypt, suggested mainly by the hieroglyphic
sculpturing on their columns and temples, find their confutation
the moment we attempt to compare the Egyptian calendar
with that either of Mexico or Peru. Traces of worship of the
sun, the earliest of all forms of natural religion, have undoubtedly
been recovered among widely scattered tribes of North
America; but there is no evidence that it was accompanied
with any definite mensuration of the solar year, or the construction
of a calendar. The changes of the seasons sufficed
for the division of the year, not only into summer and winter,
but into the diverse aspects of the seasons from month to
month; as is shown in the names given to the “moons” in
various native vocabularies. It was otherwise on the southern
continent, and among the civilised nations of Central America.
But the interblending of the science of astronomy with the
religious rites of the State produced the wonted results; and
this was peculiarly the case in Peru, with its equatorial site
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
for the temple of the Sun-God; and his seeming literal presence
on his altar at recurrent festivals. There accordingly, even as
in ancient Egypt, the divine honours paid to the heavenly bodies
was an impediment to the progress of astronomical observation.
Eclipses were regarded with the same superstitious dread as among
the rudest savage nations; and the conservatism of an established
national creed must have proved peculiarly unfavourable to astronomical
science. The impediments to Galileo’s observations
were trifling compared with those which must have beset the
Inca priest who ventured to question the diurnal revolution of
the sun round the earth, or to solve the awful mystery of an eclipse
by so simple an explanation as the interposition of the moon
between the sun and the earth. The Mexican Calendar Stone,
which embodies evidence of greater knowledge, was believed by
Humboldt to indicate unmistakable relations to the ancient
science of South-Eastern Asia. It is of more importance here to
note the shortness of the Mexican cycle, and the small amount of
error in their deviation from true solar time, as compared with the
European calendar at the time when the Spaniards first intruded
on Montezuma’s rule. That the Spaniards were ten days in
error, as compared with the Aztec reckoning, only demonstrates
the length of time during which error had been accumulating in
the reformed Julian calendar of Europe; and so tends to confirm
the idea that the civilisation of the Mexicans was of no
very great antiquity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole evidence supplied by Northern archæology
proves that in so far as it had any civilisation of foreign
origin, it must have been derived from the South, where
alike in Central and in Southern America, diverse races, and a
native civilisation replete with elements of progress, have left
behind them many enduring memorials of skill and ingenuity.
But the extremely slight and very partial traces of its influence
on any people of the northern continent would of itself suffice
to awaken doubts as to its long duration. The civilisation of
Greece and Rome did indeed exercise no direct influence on
transalpine Europe; but long centuries before the Romans
crossed the Alps, as the disclosures of the lake villages, the
crannoges, the kitchen middens, and the sepulchral mounds of
Central and Northern Europe prove, the nations beyond their
ken were familiar with weaving, and with the ceramic and
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
metallurgic arts; were far advanced as agriculturists, had
domesticated animals, acquired systems of phonetic writing, and
learned the value of a currency of the precious metals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Midway between North America with its unredeemed
barbarism, and the southern seats of a native American civilisation,
Mexico represents, as I believe, the first contact of the
latter with the former. A gleam of light was just beginning
to dawn on the horizon of the northern continent. The long
night of its Dark Ages was coming to a close, when the
intrusion of the Spaniards abruptly arrested the incipient
civilisation, and began the displacement of its aborigines and
the repetition of the Aryan ethnical revolution, which had
already supplanted the autochthones of prehistoric Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The publication in 1848 of the first volume of the
<span class='it'>Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge</span>, devoted to the
history and explorations of the ancient monuments of the
Mississippi valley, gave a wonderful stimulus to archæological
research in the United States. For a time, indeed, much
credulous zeal was devoted to the search for buried cities,
inscribed records, and the fancied recovery, in more or less
modified form, in northern areas, of the civilisation of the
Aztecs; not unmingled with dreams of Phœnician, Hebrew,
Scandinavian, and Welsh remains. The history of some of
its spurious productions is not without interest; but its true
fruits are seen in numerous works which have since issued
from the American press, devoted to an accurate record of
local antiquities. So thoroughly has this already been carried
out, that it may now be affirmed that, to all appearance, the
condition of the Indian tribes to the north of Mexico, as
shown in the rude arts of a Stone age, scarcely at all affected
in its character by their use of the native copper of Lake
Superior, represents what prevailed throughout the whole
northern continent in all the centuries—however prolonged,—since
the hunters in the Delaware valley fashioned and employed
their turtle-back celts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The condition of the nations of North America at the
period of its discovery, at the close of the fifteenth century,
may be described as one of unstable equilibrium; and nothing
in its archæological records points to an older period of any
prolonged duration of settled progress. The physical geography
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
of the continent presents in many respects such a contrast to
that of Europe, as is seen in the steppes of Northern Asia, though
with great navigable rivers, which only needed the appliances
of modern civilisation to make them for the New World what
the Euphrates and the Tigris were to Southern Asia, and the
Nile to Africa, in ancient centuries. Those vast tablelands,
the great steppes of Mongolia and Independent Tartary, have
ever been the haunts of predatory tribes by whom the civilisation
of Southern Asia has been repeatedly overthrown; and
from the same barbarian hive came the Huns who ravaged the
Roman world in its decline. Europe, on the contrary, nursed
its youthful civilisation among detached communities of its
southern peninsulas on the Mediterranean Sea; and in later
ages has repeatedly experienced the advantages of geographical
isolation in the valleys of the Alps, in Norway and Denmark,
in Portugal, the Netherlands, and the British Islands: where
nations protected in their youth from predatory hordes, and
sheltered during critical periods of change, have safely passed
through their earlier stages of progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that we know or can surmise of the nations of North
America, presents a total contrast to this. In so far as the
mystery of its prehistoric Mound-Builders has been solved, we
see there a people who had attained to a grade of civilisation
not greatly dissimilar to that of the village communities of
New Mexico and Arizona; and who had settled down in the
Ohio valley, perhaps while feudal Europe was still only
emerging from mediæval rudeness, if not at an earlier date.
The great river-valley was occupied by populous urban centres
of an industrious community. Agriculture, though prosecuted
only with the simplest implements, chiefly of wood and stone,
must have been practised on an extensive scale. The primitive
arts of the potter were improved; the copper abounding
in the remote region on the shores of Lake Superior was prized
as a rarity; though metallurgy in its practical applications
had scarcely entered on its first stage. The nation was in its
infancy; but it had passed beyond the rude hunter state, and
was entering on a settled life, with all possibilities of progress
in the future, when the fierce nomads of the north swept
down on the populous valley, and left it a desolate waste. If so,
it was but a type of the whole native history of the continent.
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>From all that can be gleaned, alike from archæological
chroniclings, Indian tradition, and the actual facts of history
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the condition of
the whole population of the northern continent has ever been
the same. It might not inaptly be compared to an ever-recurring
springtide, followed by frosts that nipped the young
germ, and rendered the promised fruitage abortive. Throughout
the whole period of French and English colonial history,
the influence of one or two savage but warlike tribes is traceable
from the St. Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico; and the
rival nations were exposed to such constant warfare that it is
more than doubtful if the natural increase of population was
latterly equal to the waste of war. Almost the sole memorials
of vanished nations are the names of some of their mountain
ranges and rivers. It is surmised, as already noted, that the
Allighewi, or Tallegwi, to whom the name common to the
Alleghany Mountains and river is traced, were the actual
Mound-Builders.<a id='r61'/><a href='#f61' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[61]</span></sup></a> If so, the history of their overthrow is not
wholly a matter of surmise. The traditions of the Delawares
told that the Alleghans were a powerful nation reaching to the
eastern shores of the Mississippi, where their palisaded towns
occupied all the choicest sites in the Ohio valley; but the
Wyandots, or Iroquois, including perhaps the Eries, who had
established themselves on the headwaters of the chief rivers
that rise immediately to the south of the great lakes, combined
with the Delawares, or Lenape nation, to crush that ancient
people; and the decimated Alleghans were driven down the
Mississippi, and dispersed. Some surviving remnant, such as
even a war of extermination spares, may have been absorbed
into the conquering nation, after the fashion systematically
pursued by the Huron-Iroquois in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. Nor is this a mere conjecture. Mr.
Horatio Hale, recognising the evident traces in the Cherokee
language of a grammar mainly Huron-Iroquois, while the
vocabulary is largely recruited from some foreign source,
thinks it not improbable that the origin of the Cherokee
nation may have been due to a union of the survivors of the
old Mound-Builder stock with some branch of the conquering
race; just as in 1649 a fugitive remnant of the Hurons from
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
the Georgian Bay were adopted into the Seneca nation;<a id='r62'/><a href='#f62' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[62]</span></sup></a> and a
few years later such of the captive Eries as escaped torture
and the stake were admitted into affiliation with their
conquerors.<a id='r63'/><a href='#f63' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[63]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole region to the east of the Mississippi, from the
fifty-second to the thirty-sixth degree of north latitude, appears
to have been occupied by the two great Indian stocks, the
Algonquin-Lenape and the Iroquois. But Gallatin, who
directed special attention to the determination of the elements
of philological affinity between them, recognised to
the south of their region the existence of at least three
essentially distinct languages of extensive use: the Catawba,
the Cherokee, and that which he assumed to include in a
common origin, both the Muskhogee and the Choctaw.<a id='r64'/><a href='#f64' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[64]</span></sup></a> But
besides those, six well-ascertained languages of smaller tribes,
including those of the Uchees and the Natchez, appear to
demand separate recognition. Their region differs essentially
from those over which the Algonquin and Iroquois war-parties
ranged at will. It is broken up by broad river channels, and
intersected by impenetrable swamps; and has thus afforded
refuge for the remnants of conquered tribes, and for the preservation
of distinct languages among small bands of refugees.
The Timucuas were the ancient occupants of Florida; but they
appear to have been displaced by the Chatta-Muskogee nations;
driven forth, as is surmised, from their homes in the Ohio
valley; and the older race is only known now by the preservation
of its language in works of the Spanish missionaries.<a id='r65'/><a href='#f65' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[65]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Ohio valley was first explored it was uninhabited;
and in the latter part of the seventeenth century
the whole region extending from Lake Erie to the Tennessee
river was an unpeopled desert. But the Cherokees were in
the occupation of their territory when first visited by De Soto
in 1540; and they are described by Bertram in 1773, with
their great council-house, capable of accommodating several
hundreds, erected on the summit of one of the large mounds,
in their town of Cowe, on the Tanase river, in Florida. But
Bertram adds: “This mound on which the rotunda stands, is
of a much ancienter date than the building, and perhaps was
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
raised for another purpose. The Cherokees themselves are as
ignorant as we are by what people, or for what purpose, these
artificial hills were raised.”<a id='r66'/><a href='#f66' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[66]</span></sup></a> It would, indeed, no more occur
to those wanderers into the deserted regions of the Mound-Builders
to inquire into the origin of their mounds, than into
that of the Alleghany Mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If then it is probable that we thus recover some clue to
the identity of the vanished race of the Ohio valley, the very
designation of the river is a memorial of their supplanters.
The Ohio is an Iroquois name given to the river of the Alleghans
by that indomitable race of savage warriors who effectually
counteracted the plans of France, under her greatest monarchs,
for the settlement of the New World. Their historian, the late
Hon. L. H. Morgan, remarks of the Iroquois: “They achieved
for themselves a more remarkable civil organisation, and acquired
a higher degree of influence, than any other race of
Indian lineage except those of Mexico and Peru. In the
drama of European colonisation, they stood, for nearly two
centuries, with an unshaken front, against the devastations of
war, the blighting influence of foreign intercourse, and the still
more fatal encroachments of a restless and advancing border
population. Under their federal system, the Iroquois flourished
in independence, and capable of self-protection, long after the
New England and Virginia races had surrendered their jurisdictions,
and fallen into the condition of dependent nations;
and they now stand forth upon the canvas of Indian history,
prominent alike for the wisdom of their civil institutions, their
sagacity in the administration of the league, and their courage
in its defence.”<a id='r67'/><a href='#f67' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[67]</span></sup></a> But to characterise the elements of combined
action among the Six Nation Indians as wise civil
institutions; or to use such terms as league and federal
system in the sense in which they are employed by the
historian of the Iroquois; is to suggest associations that are
illusory. With all the romance attached to the League of the
Hodenosauneega, they were to the last mere savages. When
the treaty which initiated the great league was entered into by
its two oldest members, the Mohawks and the Oneidas, the
former claimed the name of Kanienga, or “People of the
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
Flint.” Whatever may have been the precise idea they
attached to the designation, they were, as they remained to
the last, but in their Stone period. Their arts were of the
rudest character, and their wars had no higher aim than the
gratification of an inextinguishable hatred. All that we know
of them only serves to illustrate a condition of life such as
may have sufficed through countless generations to perpetuate
the barbarism which everywhere reveals itself in the traces of
man throughout the northern continent of America. One
nation after another perished by the fury of this race, powerful
only to destroy. The Susquehannocks, whose name still clings
to the beautiful river on the banks of which they once dwelt,
are believed to have been of the same lineage as the Alleghans;
but they incurred the wrath of the Iroquois, and perished. At
a later date the Delawares provoked a like vengeance; and the
remnant of that nation quitted for ever the shores of the river
which perpetuates their name. Such in like manner was the
fate of the Shawnees, Nanticokes, Unamis, Minsi, and Illinois.
All alike were vanquished, reduced to the condition of serfs,
or driven out and exterminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tribes that lived to the west of the Mississippi appear
to have been for the most part more strictly nomad. The
open character of the country, with its vast tracts of prairie,
and its herds of buffalo and other game, no doubt helped to
encourage a wandering life. The Crees, the Blackfeet, the
Sioux, Cheyennes, Comanches, and Apaches were all of this
class, and with their interminable feuds and perpetual migrations
rendered all settled life impossible. The Mandans, the
most civilised among the tribes of the North-West, abandoned
village after village under the continual attacks of the Sioux,
until they disappeared as a nation; and the little handful of
survivors found shelter with another tribe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this was the work of Indians. The Spaniards, indeed,
wasted and destroyed with no less merciless indiscrimination.
Not only nations perished, but a singularly interesting phase
of native civilisation was abruptly arrested in Mexico, Central
America, and Peru. The intrusion of French, Dutch, and
English colonists was, no doubt, fatal to the aborigines whom
they supplanted. Nevertheless their record is not one of
indiscriminate massacre. The relations of the French, especially
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
with the tribes with whom they were brought into immediate
contact, were on the whole kindly and protective. But as
we recover the history of the native tribes whose lands are now
occupied by the representatives of those old colonists, we find
the Indians everywhere engaged in the same exterminating
warfare; and whether we look at the earlier maps, or attempt
to reconstruct the traditionary history of older tribes, we learn
only the same tale of aimless strife and extinction. When
Cartier first explored the St. Lawrence in 1535 he found large
Indian settlements at Quebec and on the island of Montreal;
but on the return of the French under Champlain, little more
than half a century later, there were none left to dispute their
settlement. At the later date, and throughout the entire period
of French occupation, the country to the south of the St.
Lawrence and Lake Ontario was occupied by the Iroquois, or
Six Nation Indians, as they were latterly called. Westward
of the river Ottawa the whole region was deserted until near
the shores of the Georgian Bay; though its early explorers
found everywhere the traces of recent occupation by the
Wyandot or other tribes, who had withdrawn to the shores of
Lake Huron to escape the fury of their implacable foes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the period when the Hurons were first brought under
the notice of the French Jesuit missionaries in the seventeenth
century they were established along the Georgian Bay and
around Lake Simcoe; and in so far as the wild virtues of the
savage warrior are concerned, they fully equalled the Iroquois
by whom they were at length driven out and nearly exterminated.
When Locke visited Paris in 1679 the narratives
of the Jesuit fathers had rendered familiar the unflinching
endurance of this race under the frightful tortures to which
they were subjected by their Iroquois captors; and which they,
in turn, not only inflicted on their captive foes, but on one
after another of the missionaries whose devoted zeal exposed
them to their fury. We now read with interest this reflection
noted in Locke’s Journal, in which he recognises in these savages
the common motives of humanity; the same desire to win
credit and reputation, and to avoid shame and disgrace, which
animates all men: “This makes the Hurons and other people
of Canada with such constancy endure inexpressible torments;
this makes merchants in one country and soldiers in another;
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
this puts men upon school divinity in one country and physics
and mathematics in another; this cuts out the dresses for the
women, and makes the fashions for the men, and makes them
endure the inconveniences of all.” The great English philosopher
manifestly entertained no doubt that the latent elements on
which all civilisation depends were equally shared by Indian
and European. But the Hurons perished—all but a little
remnant of Christianised half-breeds now settled on the St.
Charles river below Quebec—in their very hour of contact
with European civilisation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Sagard estimated the Huron tribes at the close of
their national history, when they had been greatly reduced in
numbers, as still between thirty and forty thousand. But
besides these there lay between them and the shores of Lake
Erie and the Niagara river the Tiontonones and the Attiwendaronks,
and to the south of the Great Lake the Eries, all
of the same stock, and all sharers in the same fate. Tradition
points to the kindling of the council-fire of peace among the
Attiwendaronks before the organisation of the Iroquois confederacy.
Father Joseph de la Roche d’Allyon, who passed
through their country when seeking to discover the source of
the Niagara river, speaks of twenty-eight towns and villages
under the rule of its chief Sachem, and of their extensive cultivation
of maize, beans, and tobacco. They had won, moreover,
the strange character of being lovers of peace, and were styled
by the French the Neuters, from the desire they manifested to
maintain a friendly neutrality alike with the Hurons and the
Iroquois. Of the Eries we know less. In the French maps
of the seventeenth century the very existence of the great lake
which perpetuates their name was unknown; but the French
fur-traders were aware of a tribe existing to the west of the
Iroquois, whose country abounded with the lynx or wild cat,
the fur of which was specially prized, and they designated it
“La Nation du Chat.” To their artistic skill are ascribed
several remains of aboriginal art, among which a pictorial
inscription on Cunningham’s Island is described as by far the
most elaborate work of its class hitherto found on the continent.<a id='r68'/><a href='#f68' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[68]</span></sup></a>
From the partial glimpses thus recovered of both nations we
are tempted to ascribe to them an aptitude for civilisation fully
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
equal to that of which the boasted federal league of the Iroquois
gave evidence. But they perished by the violence of
kindred nations before either the French or English could
establish intercourse with them; and their fate doubtless reveals
to us glimpses of history such as must have found frequent
repetition in older centuries throughout the whole North
American continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The legend of the peace-pipe, Longfellow’s poetic version of
the Red Indian Edda, founded on traditions of the Iroquois
narrated by an Onondaga chief, represents Gitche Manito, the
Master of Life, descending on the crag of the red pipestone
quarry at the Côteau des Prairies, and calling all the tribes
together:—</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>And they stood there on the meadow</p>
<p class='line0'>With their weapons and their war gear,</p>
<p class='line0'>Wildly glaring at each other.</p>
<p class='line0'>In their faces stern defiance,</p>
<p class='line0'>In their hearts the feuds of ages,</p>
<p class='line0'>The hereditary hatred,</p>
<p class='line0'>The ancestral thirst of vengeance.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>So far the picture is true to nature; but no dream of a
millennial era for the Red Man, in which all were thenceforth
to live together as brothers, can have fashioned itself in the
mind of Indian seer. The Sioux, the Crees, and the Blackfeet,
still continued to nurse the same feud of ages, and thirsted
for each other’s blood, while European emigrants crowd in to
take possession of their vast prairies, destined to become the
granaries of the world. The buffalo, on which they mainly
depended for their food, and their téepees or tents, have vanished
from their prairies, and will ere long be as extinct as the
fossil urus or mastodon. The Red Man of the North-West
exhibits no change from his precursors of the fifteenth century;
and for aught that appears in him of a capacity for self-development,
the forests and prairies of the American continent
may have sheltered hunting and warring tribes of Indians, just
as they have sheltered and pastured its wild herds of buffaloes,
for countless centuries since the continent rose from its
ocean bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only by prolonged hereditary feuds, more insatiable, and
therefore more destructive in their results than the ravages of
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
tigers or wolves, is it possible to account for such an unprogressive
condition of humanity as the archæological disclosures
of the northern continent seem to reveal? Its numerous
rivers and lakes, and its boundless forests and prairies, afforded
inexhaustible resources for the hunter, and both soil and
climate have proved admirably adapted for agriculture. Still
more, the great copper region of Lake Superior provided
advantages such as have existed in few other countries of the
known world for developing the first stages of metallurgic art
on which civilisation so largely depends. Whether brought
with them from Asia, or discovered for themselves, the grand
secret of the mastery of the ores by fire was already familiar
to Peruvian metallurgists, and not unknown to those of Mexico.
Unalloyed copper, such as that which abounds in the igneous
rocks of the Keweenaw peninsula on Lake Superior, is
extremely difficult to cast; and the addition of a small percentage
of tin not only produces the useful bronze alloy, but renders
the copper more readily fusible. This all-important secret of
science the metallurgists of Peru had discovered for themselves,
and turned largely to practical account. The pictured
chronicles of the Mexicans throw an interesting light on the
value they attached to the products of this novel art. It
appears from some of their paintings that the tribute due by
certain provinces was paid in wedges of copper. The forms of
these, as well as of chisels and other tools of bronze, are simple,
and indicate no great ingenuity in adapting the moulded metal
to the artificer’s or the combatant’s requirements. The methods
of hafting the axe-blade appear to have been of nearly the
same rude description as are in use by modern savages in
fitting the handle to a hatchet of flint or stone; and the whole
characteristics of their implements suggest the probability that
their metallurgy was a recently acquired art, derived from the
civilised races on whom they had intruded as conquerors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such knowledge, partial as it was, must have been derived
from the south. Everywhere to the north of the Mexican
Gulf we look in vain for anything more than the mere
hammered native copper, untouched by fire. Dr. J. W. Foster
does indeed quote Mr. Perkins, who himself possesses sixty
copper implements, including knives, spear heads, chisels, and
objects of anomalous form, as having arrived at the conclusion
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
“that, by reason of certain markings, it was evident that the
Mound-Builders possessed the art of smelting copper,”<a id='r69'/><a href='#f69' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[69]</span></sup></a> but the
illustrations produced in proof of it scarcely bear out the
opinion. The same idea has been repeatedly advanced; but the
contents of the Mounds amply prove that if such a knowledge
had dawned on their builders it was turned to no practical
account. Mr. Charles Rau, in his <span class='it'>Ancient Aboriginal Trade in
North America</span>, says: “Although the fire on the hearths or altars
now enclosed by the sacrificial mounds was sometimes sufficiently
strong to melt the deposited copper articles, it does not
seem that this proceeding induced the ancient inhabitants to
avail themselves of fire in working copper; they persisted in
the tedious practice of hammering. Yet one copper axe,
evidently cast, and resembling those taken from the mounds
of Ohio, has been ploughed up near Auburn, in Cayuga, in the
State of New York. This specimen, which bears no trace of
use, may date from the earlier times of European colonisation.
It certainly would be wrong to place much stress on such an
isolated case.”<a id='r70'/><a href='#f70' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[70]</span></sup></a> The well-known volume of Messrs. Squier
and Davis furnishes illustrations of copper and other metallic
relics from the mounds of Ohio.<a id='r71'/><a href='#f71' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[71]</span></sup></a> Mr. J. T. Short engraves a

have been found in unusual abundance.<a id='r72'/><a href='#f72' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[72]</span></sup></a> In the Annual
Report of the Historical Society of Wisconsin for 1878 the
copper implements in their collection are stated to number one
hundred and ninety implements, classified as spear or dirk
heads, knives, chisels, axes, augurs, gads, and drills, in addition
to beads, tubes, and other personal ornaments made out of
thin sheets of hammered copper. Dr. J. W. Foster has
furnished illustrations of the various types from the valuable
collection of Mr. Perkins.<a id='r73'/><a href='#f73' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[73]</span></sup></a> Colonel Charles C. Jones engraves

and Dr. Abbott shows the prevailing forms of the same
class of relics found along the whole northern Atlantic
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
seaboard.<a id='r75'/><a href='#f75' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[75]</span></sup></a> All tell the same tale of rudest manipulation by
a people ignorant of the working of metals with the use of
fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet the native copper was ready to hand in a form
and in quantity unknown elsewhere. No such supplies of the
pure metal invited the industry of the first Asiatic or European
metallurgists. The Cassiterides yielded in abundance the ores
of copper and tin, but these had to be smelted and worked
with all the accumulated results of tentative skill before they
yielded the copper or more useful bronze. By whom or where
this first knowledge was mastered is unknown: the tendency
is still to look to Asia, perhaps to Phœnicia, or to the still
undetermined cradle of the Aryans, wherever that may prove
to have been, for the birth of this phase of metallurgic art
which constituted so important a stage in early civilisation.
Yet if the ancient American missed it, it was not for want of
opportunity. Examples of the accidental fusion of copper by
the sacrificial fires of the Mound-Builders repeatedly occur in
the mounds of the Ohio valley. But no gifted native alchymist
was prompt to read the lesson and turn it to practical account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Asia and Europe appear to have passed by a natural
transition, step by step, from their rudest stages of lithic art
to polished stone, and then to implements of metal. Some of
the steps were doubtless very slow. Worsaae believed that
the use of bronze prevailed in Denmark “five or six hundred
years before the birth of Christ.”<a id='r76'/><a href='#f76' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[76]</span></sup></a> In Egypt it undoubtedly
was known at a greatly earlier date. I still incline to my
early formed opinion, that gold was the first metal worked.
Found in nuggets, it could scarcely fail to attract attention.
It was easy to fashion into shape; and some of the small,
highly polished stone hammers seem fitter for this than any
other work.<a id='r77'/><a href='#f77' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[77]</span></sup></a> The abundant gold ornaments of the New World
at the time of the discovery of Mexico and Peru accord with
this idea. The like attraction of the bright native copper, is
proved by its employment among the southern Indians for personal
ornaments; and in this way the economic use of the
metals may have been first suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the working of gold nuggets, or of virgin copper, with
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
the hammer, to the smelting of the ores, was no trifling step;
but that knowledge once gained, the threshold of civilisation
and true progress had been reached. The history of the grand
achievement is embodied in the earliest myths both of the Old
and the New World. Tubal-cain, Dædalus, Hephæstus,
Vulcan, Vœlund, Galant, the Luno or the Celtic Fingal, and
Wayland, the Saxon smith-god, are but legendary variations
of the first worker by whom the gift of metallurgy was
communicated to man; and so too the New World has its
Quetzalcoatl, or Vœlund of the Aztecs, the divine instructor of
their ancestors in the use of the metals. But whatever be
the date of this wise instructor, no share of the knowledge
communicated by him to that favoured race appears to have
ever penetrated northward of the Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is vain to urge such dubious evidence as the fancied
traces of a mould-ridge, or the solitary example of a casting of
uncertain age, in proof of a knowledge of the furnace and the
crucible among any North American tribe. Everywhere in
Europe the soil yields not only its buried relics of gold,
copper, and bronze, but also stone and bronze moulds in which
implements and personal ornaments were cast. When the
ingenious systematising of Danish archæologists had familiarised
the students of antiquity with the idea of a succession of
Stone, Bronze, and Iron periods in the history of Europe, the
question naturally followed, whether metallurgy did not begin,
there, as elsewhere, in the easy working of virgin copper. Dr.
Latham accordingly remarked, in his <span class='it'>Ethnology of the British
Islands</span>, on the supposition that no unalloyed copper relics had
been found in Britain: “Stone and bone first; then bronze, or
copper and tin combined; but no copper alone. I cannot get
over this hiatus; cannot imagine a metallurgic industry
beginning with the use of alloys.” It was a mistake, however,
to assume that no copper relics had ever been found.
At first it had been taken for granted that all such implements
were of the familiar alloy. But so soon as the importance of
the distinction was recognised, examples of pure copper were
forthcoming. So early as 1822, Sir David Brewster described
a large axe of peculiar shape, and formed of copper, which was
found in the hard black till-clay at a depth of twenty feet
under Ratho Bog, near Edinburgh. This is no solitary
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
example. The Scottish Museum of Antiquities has other
implements of pure copper; and Sir William Wilde states in
reference to the collections of the Royal Irish Academy: “upon
careful examination, it has been found that thirty of the
rudest, and apparently the very oldest celts, are of red, almost
unalloyed copper”; as is also the case with some other rudely
formed tools in the same collection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a temporary advantage, doubtless, but a real loss, to
the Indian miners of Lake Superior that they found the native
copper there ready to hand, a pure ductile metal, probably
regarded by them as only a variety of stone which—unlike its
rocky matrix,—they could bend, or hammer into shape, without
fracture. Its value as such was widely appreciated.
Copper tools, everywhere retaining the specs, or larger crystals
of silver, characteristic of the Lake Superior veins, tell of the
diffusion of the metal from that single source throughout all
the vast regions watered by the Mississippi and its tributaries,
and eastward by lake and river to the gulf of the St. Lawrence
and the mouth of the Hudson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a time when this traffic must have been
systematically carried on; when the ancient miners of Lake
Superior worked its rich copper veins with industrious zeal;
and when, probably as part of the same aggressive energy, the
valley of the Ohio was filling with a settled population; its
great earthworks were in process of construction, and a native
race entered on a course that gave promise of social progress.
But, from whatever cause, the work of the old miners was
abruptly terminated;<a id='r78'/><a href='#f78' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[78]</span></sup></a> the race of the Mounds vanished from
the scenes of their ingenious toil; and rudest barbarism
resumed its sway over the whole northern continent. The
same Aryan race that, before the dawn of history, before the
Sanskrit-speaking people of India, or the Zends of Persia,
entered on their southern homes, spoke in its own cradleland
the mother tongue of Sanskrit, Greek, Celtic, and German,
at length broke up and went forth on its long wanderings.
Whatever peoples it found there; they were replaced by Celts,
Romans, Greeks, Slavs, and Teutons, who broke in upon the barbarism
of prehistoric Europe; displaced the older races, Allophylian,
Neolithic, Iberian, Finnic, or by whatever other name we
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
may find it convenient to designate them; but not without
a considerable intermingling of the old blood with that of
the intruders. The sparsely settled continent gradually filled
up. Forests were cleared, swamps drained, rivers confined by
artificial banks and levées to their channels; and there grew
up in their new homes the Celtic, Classic, Slavic, and Teutonic
tongues, with all the varied culture and civilisation which they
represent. Agriculture, the special characteristic of the whole
Aryan race, flourished. They brought with them the cereals;
and, with plenty, the favoured race multiplied, till at length it
has grown straitened within the bounds of the old continent
which it had made its own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the close of the fifteenth century one great cycle,
that of Europe’s mediæval era, came to an end; and then we
trace the first beginnings of that fresh scattering of the Aryan
clan, and its new western movement across the Ocean. It
seems in a very striking manner once more to repeat itself
under our own eyes, as we look abroad on the millions
crowding from Europe and filling up the western wilderness;
hewing down the forests, cultivating the waste prairies, and
everywhere displacing the rude aborigines: yet here also
not without some interblending of the races; though the two
types, Aryan and pre-Aryan, meet under all the repellent
influences of high civilisation and the lowest barbarism. In
the Canadian North-West alone, the young province of
Manitoba began its political existence with a population
of between 10,000 and 12,000 half-breeds; in part at least,
a hardy race of hunters and farmers; the representatives of
what is as certainly destined to constitute an element in the
new phases which the Aryan race already begins to assume,
under the diverse conditions of a new continent, as that curious
trace of Europe’s pre-Aryan people which attracted the
observant attention of Tacitus among the ancient Britons;
and which we are learning to recognise, with a new significance,
as the Melanochroi: the representatives of the old half-breed
of Europe’s prehistoric dawn.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span><h1>V<br/> THE ÆSTHETIC FACULTY IN ABORIGINAL RACES</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> ingenious arts of the palæolithic cave-dwellers of the
Vézère abundantly prove that it needed no wanderers from the
cradlelands of Old World civilisation to that strange Atlantis
lying in the engirdling ocean beyond the Pillars of Hercules,
to engraft their artistic capacities on the “Achoriens” by whom
it was peopled. The innate faculty for art has manifested
itself in individuals and in nations, among widely diverse
Assyrian, Egyptian, Hellenic, Arabian, and mediæval races, as
in later Frank, Fleming, and Dane, with unaccountable
partiality. For its absence, or very subordinate manifestation,
is seen to be compatible with the highest intellectual
triumphs in other directions. The arts of Britain’s Allophyliæ
manifest no instinctive aim at a reproduction of familiar
natural objects, such as is characteristic of some races at a
very primitive stage. Nor was it till a recent generation that
the stock from which Shakespeare and Newton sprung put
forth its first efforts at rivalling the great masters of the
Renaissance, or entering into competition with the skilled
painters of the Low Countries. It is otherwise with the
nations of the New World. The highest stage of civilisation
attained there is a very partial one. But among the various
characteristics of the American aborigines which invite
attention, the very wide diffusion of an aptitude for imitative
art is one that merits careful study as typical of American
man. It is not, indeed, to be overlooked that if due allowance
be made for the narrow range in degrees of civilisation among
the races of the New World, the same diversity of racial
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
characteristics is observable there as elsewhere. The tendency,
moreover, of civilisation is to efface, or greatly to modify, such
distinctions. Civilised nations habitually borrow the arts and
imitate the social habits of neighbouring races, or accept some
common standard of intellectual and moral pre-eminence.
Nevertheless, while the capacity for imitative art is neither
peculiar to the New World, nor characteristic of all its diverse
nationalities, it appears to be more generally diffused among
the races of America than elsewhere. It is prevalent among
tribes in nearly every condition, from the rude Indian nomad,
or the Eskimo, to the semi-civilised Zuñi, and the skilled
metallurgists and architects of Central America and Peru.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This development of a feeling for art in savage races is at
all times interesting as indicative of intellectual capacity and
powers of observation, even when manifested, as it frequently
is, within a very narrow range. It is by no means a general
characteristic either of savage or civilised man. Yet recent
archæological discoveries prove it to have been one of the
earliest forms of intellectual activity among the cave-dwellers
of Europe’s palæolithic dawn. The most civilised nations
have differed widely in the manifestations of this æsthetic
faculty. The city of Dante was the Athens of the Middle
Ages in art as well as letters; while the land which gave birth
to Shakespeare can scarcely be said to have had a native
school of painting or sculpture till late in the eighteenth century.
The like differences are observable among barbarous nations.
Races are met with, to whom the drawing of a familiar object
suggests no idea of the original; while others, in nearly the
same stage of savage life, habitually practise the representation
of natural objects in the decorative details of their implements
and articles of dress, and in the carvings which furnish
occupation for many leisure hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A special interest attaches to the disclosures of archæology
relative to the prehistoric races of Europe, owing to the evidence
thereby furnished of striking resemblances in their arts and conditions
of life to those of uncultured races of our own day. In
many respects it seems as though the present condition of some
existing races of America only repeats that of Europe’s infancy.
But so far as imitative art is concerned, the analogy fails
when the more recent contents of the barrows, cairns, and grave
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
mounds of prehistoric Europe are brought into comparison
with those of the New World. If, indeed, we leave behind us
the age of cromlechs, kistvaens, cairns, and barrows, and seek
to estimate aright the disclosures of artistic ability pertaining
to the far more ancient men of Europe’s Mammoth and Reindeer
periods, it is otherwise. But, before reviewing the
wonderfully definite glimpses thereby furnished of tribes of
rude yet skilful hunters of that post-glacial world, it may be
of some help, in the comparisons which they suggest, to recall
impressions derived from a study of that Stone period in
which the natives of the British Islands appear to have approximated,
in many respects, to the Red Indian nomad of the
American forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One little-heeded point of evidence of this correspondence,
to which I long since drew attention, is to be found in the
traces of artificial modification of the head-form in ancient
British crania; a comparison of which with skulls recovered
from Indian grave mounds helps to throw light on the habits
and social life of the British Islands in prehistoric times. In
illustration of this I may refer to an exploration, now of old
date. In the early summer of 1851, I learned of the accidental
exposure of a stone cist, in trenching a garden at Juniper
Green, a few miles distant from Edinburgh, and immediately
proceeded to the spot. There, under a slightly elevated knoll—the
remains, in all probability, of the ancient barrow,—lay
a rude sarcophagus of unhewn sandstone, within which was a
male skeleton, still in good preservation. The body had been
laid on its left side, with the arms folded over the breast, and
the knees drawn up so as to touch the elbows. A flat water-worn
stone formed the pillow, from which the skull had rolled
to the bottom of the cist. Above the right shoulder stood a
gracefully formed clay vase, containing only a little sand and
black dust, the remains, it may be presumed, of food which it
originally contained when deposited there by affectionate
hands, in some long-forgotten century. It was recovered uninjured,
and is now deposited, along with the skull, in the
Archæological Museum of Edinburgh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The primitive grave, thus discovered within sight of the
Scottish capital, has a curious interest as a link connecting the
present with a remote past. But the special point which
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
throws light on the habits of the ancient race, is a parieto-occipital
flattening, such as is of common occurrence in skulls
recovered from American ossuaries and grave mounds. This
feature is clearly traceable to the use of the cradle-board in
infancy. The mode of nursing the Indian papoose, by bandaging
it on a cradle-board, is specially adapted to the vicissitudes
of a nomad forest life. The infant is carried safely,
slung on the mother’s back, leaving her hands free; and in
the pauses of her journey, or when engaged in field work, it
can be laid aside, or suspended from the branch of a tree,
without risk of injury. But one result of this custom is that
the soft bones of the skull are subjected to a continuous
pressure in one direction during the whole term of suckling,
which is necessarily protracted, among a nomad people, much
longer than is usual in settled communities; and to this cause
is undoubtedly traceable the occipital flattening of many skulls
recovered from European cists and barrows. Dr. L. A. Gosse,
after discussing in his <span class='it'>Essai sur les déformations artificielles du
Crâne</span> certain artificial modifications of the skull, of common
occurrence among the aborigines of the New World, thus proceeds:
“Passant dans l’ancient continent, ne tardons-nous
pas à reconnaître que ce berceau plat et solide y a produit des
effets analogues. Les anciens habitants de la Scandinavie et de
la Calédonie devaient s’en servir, si l’on en juge par la forme
de leurs crânes.”<a id='r79'/><a href='#f79' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[79]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Full-sized representations of the Juniper Green skull, and
others of the same type, are given in <span class='it'>Crania Britannica</span>.<a id='r80'/><a href='#f80' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[80]</span></sup></a>
Bateman also, in his <span class='it'>Ten Years’ Diggings in Celtic and Saxon
Gravehills</span>, concurs with earlier writers in ascribing to the use
of the cradle-board the flattened occiput observed in skulls
recovered from British barrows. The employment, indeed, of
the cradle-board among prehistoric races of Northern Europe,
and their nomad life of which it is so characteristic a feature,
may now be considered as generally recognised. The implements
and pottery recovered from graves of the period show
their constructors to have been, for the most part, devoid of
any knowledge of metals; or, at best, in the mere rudimentary
stage of metallurgic arts. But the Juniper Green cist, that of
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
the large Staffordshire barrow of Wotton Hill, that of Roundway
Hill, North Wilts, another of Green Lowe, Derbyshire,
and others described in the works above referred to, while all
disclosing evidence of correspondence in habits and social
condition between ancient races of the British Isles and the
Indians of the New World, also furnished characteristic
examples of their fictile ware; and here the analogy fails.
There are, indeed, abundant specimens of broken Indian
pottery on many of their deserted village sites, which might
be mingled with the fragments of a like kind from early
European grave mounds without attracting special attention.
Simple chevron and saltier or herring-bone patterns, scratched
with a pointed bone on the soft clay, are common to both;
and many of the more elaborate linear and bead patterns of
the primitive British potters reappear with slight variation on
the Indian ware. But besides those, few ancient Indian
village sites fail to yield fragments of pottery, including clay
tobacco pipes, ornamented with more or less rude imitations
of the human face and of familiar animals, such as the beaver,
the bear, the lynx, and the deer. Before my first visit to the
American continent, while still preoccupied with the arts of
the ancient British savage, and the more graceful devices of
the metallurgists of Europe’s Bronze period, I noted the prevalence
of a conventional ornamentation, consisting mainly of
improvements on what may be called the accidents of manufacture,
or possibly of linear decorations borrowed from
patterns of the plaiter or knitter.<a id='r81'/><a href='#f81' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[81]</span></sup></a> No attempt appears to
have been made by the old European decorator at such imitations
of familiar natural objects as are now known to have
been practised among the far more ancient cave-dwellers of
Europe, the contemporaries of the mammoth and the woolly
rhinoceros, and which are familiar to us in the primitive arts
of the New World. Objects recovered from the mounds of
the Ohio and the Mississippi valleys, as well as the diversified
products of the native artificers of Mexico and Peru, attract
special attention by their endless variety of imitative design;
and similar skill and ingenuity are apparent in the pottery,
the plaited manufactures, the stone and bone carvings, and
even in many of the great animal mounds and other earthworks
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
of the North American continent. An observant
recognition of analogies, traceable in the rhetorical construction
of many American Indian holophrasms, appears to be
only another phase of this widely prevalent imitative faculty.
At the same time, whether we study the physical form or the
intellectual characteristics of native American races, it becomes
more and more apparent that the New World has been
peopled from different centres, and still presents essentially
distinct types of race. It had its ferocious Caribs, its
Mexicans, with their revolting human sacrifices and other
bloody rites, and its stealthy, treacherous nomads, less courageous
but not less cruel. But it has also gentler races, in
whom, as in the Peruvians, the Zuñis, and others of the
Pueblo Indians, the æsthetic faculty predominates, and overlays
with many a graceful concomitant the utilitarian products
of their industrial arts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether barbarous or civilised nations are classified in
accordance with their linguistic affinities, both are found to
manifest other specialties according with the diverse families
of speech. The differences which separate the Aryan from
the Semitic races are not more marked than the intellectual
and moral divergencies among barbarous tribes. But while
this is apparent on the American continent, its diverse races
appear to be characterised by a more general aptitude for
artistic imitation than is observable elsewhere, except among
the long-civilised nations of the Old World, whose composite
vocabularies reveal the sources of many borrowed arts. The
Peruvian potter sketched and modelled endless quaint devices
in clay; the Zuñian decorated his gracefully fashioned ware
with highly effective parti-coloured designs; and the old
Mound-Builder wrought in intaglio on his domestic and
sepulchral vessels conventional flower patterns; and in his
miniature sculptures reproduced the fauna of an area extending
from the Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico. Native artificers
of widely different American races manifest this imitative
faculty. Not only is the Indian pipe sculptor found copying
animate and inanimate objects with an observant eye and a
ready hand, but even the linear patterns on pottery and straw
basket-work are frequently made to assume combinations
obviously suggested by flowers and other familiar objects of
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
nature. The perception of such analogies, and even the
capacity for appreciating the linear or pictorial representation
of objects on a flat surface, varies greatly in different races.
Travellers have repeatedly described the manifestation by
savage races of an utter incapacity to comprehend pictured
representations. Mr. Oldfield, for example, tells how a large
coloured engraving of a native of New Holland was shown to
some Australians. “One declared it to be a ship, another a
kangaroo, and so on, not one of a dozen identifying the portrait
as having any connection with himself.”<a id='r82'/><a href='#f82' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[82]</span></sup></a> The artistic
faculty is unquestionably hereditary. There are artistic
families and artistic races. But if so, the pictorial skill of
the palæolithic cave-dwellers of Western Europe was not
transmitted to their successors. Guided not only by a comparison
of their tools and weapons with those of the Neolithic
period, but also by cranial and other physical evidence, we are
led to assume the absence of affinity between the men of the
Perigord caves and the greatly more modern races of Europe’s
later Stone period; and their lack of the imitative faculty, so
characteristic of the elder race, adds confirmation to this
opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Artistic sympathies, and a capacity for high achievements
in painting and sculpture, are neither the direct results of
civilisation, nor in many cases the product of culture and
training. From the days of Giotto, the shepherd boy, to
those of Thorwaldsen, Wilkie, and Turner, art-power is not
only seen to be a direct and exceptional gift of nature, but it
is frequently the product of a singularly partial intellectual
development. Leonardo da Vinci and Michael Angelo are
examples of men of rare and comprehensive genius, who
sought in art the form in which to give expression to their
many-sided powers. But, on the other hand, instances are
not rare of artists like Thorwaldsen or Turner, who, except
within the range of their own special art, seemed exceptionally
defective in the exercise of ordinary mental powers. The
same is true of races as of individuals. Some show an
aptitude for art wholly wanting in others, who nevertheless
equal or surpass them in more important qualities. The
æsthetic faculty may, indeed, be described as curiously
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
capricious in its manifestations. The Papuans of New Guinea
and of New Caledonia, a race of Negrillos, in some points
presenting analogies to the Australian, are nevertheless remarkable
for a seemingly instinctive ingenuity and aptitude
for art. Mr. Wallace describes them as contrasting with the
Malay race in the habitual decoration of their canoes, houses,
and almost every domestic utensil, with elaborate carving.
The Fijians, who are allied to this Negrillo race, present in
many respects an unfavourable contrast to the true Polynesian.
In their physiognomy and whole physical aspect they are
inferior to other island races of the Pacific; and are further
notable for repulsive habits and a general condition of social
and moral degradation. But their ferocity and the cruel
customs in which they so strikingly differ from the Malays
are vices of a vigorous race. They have frequently been
observed to indicate energy capable of being directed to useful
ends, as has been the case with the Maori cannibals of New
Zealand, and was seen of old in the Huns and the Northmen,
whose descendants are now among the most civilised races of
the world. It is obvious, at any rate, that the savage vices of
the Fijians are compatible with considerable skill in such arts
as pertain to their primitive condition. Their musical instruments
are superior to those of the Polynesians, and include
the pan-pipe and others unknown in the islands beyond their
range. Their pottery exhibits great variety of form; and
some of the vessels combined in groups present a curious
correspondence to familiar examples of Peruvian art. Their
fishing-nets and lines are remarkable for neat and skilful
workmanship, and they carry on agriculture to a considerable
extent. “Indeed,” remarked the ethnologist of the United
States Expedition, in summing up the characteristics of the
Fijians, “we soon began to perceive that the people were in
possession of almost every art known to the Polynesians, and
of many others besides. The highly-finished workmanship
was unexpected, everything being executed until recently, and
even now for the most part, without the use of iron. In the
collection of implements and manufactures brought home by
the Expedition, the observer will distinguish in the Fijian
division something like a school of arts for the other Pacific
islands.”
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>All this has to be kept in view, in any attempt to gauge
the intellectual development, or determine the degree of
civilisation, of the palæolithic draughtsmen and carvers of the
Garonne. One of the scenes introduced by M. Figuier, in the
fanciful illustrations of his <span class='it'>L’Homme primitif</span>, represents a
group of artists, such as, except for their costume, might have
been sketched from the students of the École des Beaux Arts.
Their mode of work was probably much more akin to the
intermittent labours of the Indian, whose elaborately sculptured
pipe is laid aside, and resumed again—often after prolonged
intervals,—before it receives the finishing touch. But
though the drawings and the carvings of those primitive artists
alike manifest remarkable skill and observant imitation, the
former are the objects of special interest. Their carvings
appear to have been executed, with rare exceptions, for the
decoration of favourite implements and weapons, in accordance
with a practice common to many diverse races and conditions
of society. But the drawings have no such motive. They
more nearly correspond to the sketch or drawing from nature
of the modern artist; and furnish evidence of peculiar attributes,
strikingly distinguishing the race of that remote age
from most others that have succeeded them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certain it is that, so far as present evidence goes, the
greatly prolonged Neolithic period was characterised by no
such artistic feeling or imitative skill. Specimens of the
ingenious handiwork of the artificers of Europe’s later Stone
age abound. We have numerous relics from the kitchen
middens of Denmark, the pile villages of Switzerland, the crannoges
of Scotland and Ireland, as well as the varied contents
of cromlechs, cists, cairns, and barrows, diligently explored
throughout Europe. But no such examples of carvings, or
graven representations of animals or other natural objects, have
been found. The “clay in the hands of the potter” is a
familiar symbol of plastic response to the will of the designer.
It is, indeed, easier for the practised modeller to fashion the clay
into any desired form, than to draw it, subject to rules of perspective,
on a flat surface. Linear devices and the representation of
objects in intaglio, or in low relief, are also accomplished with
great facility on the soft clay. Hence the art of diverse races,
periods, and stages of progress, finds its aptest illustration in
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
fictile ware; and the imitative faculty of widely different
American races may be studied in their pottery. In Mexico,
apparently, we have to look for the northern school of ceramic
art. There, the aggressive races of the North first came in
contact with the civilisation of Central America; and the
native aptitude for imitative representation received a fresh
impulse. The Indian modeller learned to work skilfully in
clay; and the variety of design, combined with the quaint
humour of the caricaturist, displayed in many of the Mexican
terra-cottas, serves to indicate this class of work as specially
significant in relation to the present inquiry. The inventive
fancy and skill of the Peruvian potter illustrates in ampler
variety the progress achieved by the races of the southern
continent. But this will more fitly come under review along
with other examples of modern native art. For no analogous
traces of contemporary modelling in clay furnish material for
comparison with the art of the Palæolithic era; though the
skill of its bone and ivory carvers was in no degree inferior to
that of the Mexican or Peruvian modeller. But the æsthetic
aptitude of that old race of Europe’s intellectual dawn is in
some respects unique. In so far as their ingenious arts furnish
any evidence of true racial characteristics, the men of the
Neolithic era inherited none of their æsthetic feelings; nor did
the imitative faculty manifest itself with exceptional power until
the advent of the Aryan races brought with it the potentialities
of Hellenic inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The absence of nearly every trace of imitative art in the
prehistoric remains of Britain has already been noted. It made
a strong impression on my mind at an early stage of my
archæological researches; for this characteristic of European art
extends over a period of greatly prolonged duration, marked by
the advent and disappearance of races, dissimilar alike in
physical and mental characteristics. We have the laboriously
finished implements of neolithic art, the pottery of at least two
distinct races seemingly prior to the Celts, and then the graceful
artistic productions of the Bronze period, but still only the
rarest traces of any effort at imitation. Long before the
imitative arts of the American continent were known to me
otherwise than from description, I remarked, of the archaic art of
the first British metallurgists: “The ornamentation consists,
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
almost without exception, only of improvements on the
accidents of manufacture. The incised decorations of the
pottery appear, in many cases, to have been produced simply
by passing twisted cords round the soft clay. More complicated
designs, most frequently consisting of chevron, saltire, or
herring-bone patterns, where they are not merely the results of
a combination of such lines, have been suggested, as I conceive,
by the few and half-accidental patterns of the industrious
female knitter. In no single case is any attempt made at the
imitation of a leaf or flower, of animals, or any other simple
objects.”<a id='r83'/><a href='#f83' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[83]</span></sup></a> At the date of those remarks the art of Europe’s
Palæolithic era was unknown; but with the arts of other
primitive races, and especially those of the American continent,
in view, I then added: “It is curious, indeed, and noteworthy, to
find how entirely every trace of imitative art is absent in
British archaic relics; for it is by no means an invariable
characteristic of primitive arts.” Dr. Hoffman, when commenting
on aboriginal American art among the Indians of California,
adds: “I have not met with any attempts at objective drawings
or etchings which may be attributed to the Tshuma Indians, who
were the former occupants of the island;<a id='r84'/><a href='#f84' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[84]</span></sup></a> but ornamentations
upon shells and bone beads, soap-stone pipes, shell pendants, and
other ornaments, seem to consist entirely of straight or zigzag
lines, cross-lines, circles,” etc. The earliest examples of native
metallurgy in Britain are to be found in the works of the
primitive goldsmith; but the same conventional ornamentation
which occurs on early pottery, is characteristic of the beautiful
personal ornaments of gold belonging, for the most part, to the
first period of working in metals. It is not till a late stage of
the European Bronze period that imitative art reappears, and
zoomorphic decorations become common.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The discovery in 1868, and subsequent years, of numerous
specimens of the artistic ability of the cave-men of palæolithic
Europe, revealed a singularly interesting phase of primitive
history. Remains of the so-called “Reindeer period” are now
familiar to us from many localities; for the range of this
animal in palæolithic times appears to have extended from the
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
Baltic to the Pyrenees. But a special interest was conferred on
the first disclosures by the locality itself, where the Vézère, an
affluent of the river Dordogne, winds its way through the
cretaceous limestone, in which occur numerous caves and rock-shelters,
rich in remains of primitive art. In this region of
South-western France, where many historical and legendary
associations carry the fancy back to elder centuries, the
Dordogne unites with the Garonne at its estuary below Bordeaux.
The upper waters of the Dordogne form the boundary
between Limousin and Auvergne, and the Vézère is one of its
highest tributaries in Limousin. There, nearly in the latitude
of Montreal, but with the genial climate which, throughout the
whole historic period, has characterised Southern France, lie the
caves of Cro-Magnon, La Moustier, Gorge d’Enfer, Laugerie
Haute and Basse, and La Madelaine: the long-sealed art
galleries of prehistoric Gaul. The reindeer and the aurochs
haunted its forests; the woolly rhinoceros and the mammoth
still frequented its glades; and the long-extinct fossil horse
was not only an object of the chase, but was possibly already
subdued to the companionship and service of man. Such, at
least, is the idea suggested by a scene graven on the portion of
a baton or staff, found by M. Lartet and Mr. Christy in La
Madelaine cave, which represents a man between two horses’
heads, apparently walking past, with a staff or spear over his
shoulder. Nor were those man’s sole contemporaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drawings of the ancient cave-men are of varying
degrees of merit, showing the efforts of the unskilled tyro as
well as of the practised artist. Some of the examples found
at Laugerie Basse—as, for instance, the assumed representation
of an ibex, with its legs folded as if sitting,—are the crude
efforts of unpractised draughtsmen, and would compare unfavourably
with many examples of graphic art, the work of modern
Eskimo and Indian gravers and draughtsmen. But other specimens—such
as the mammoth from La Madelaine cave, and
the Alpine ibex and reindeers from Laugerie Basse, in Southern
France, and, still more, the remarkably spirited drawing of the
reindeer grazing, from the Kesserloch, near Thayingen, sketched
on a piece of reindeer horn,—evince powers of observation, and
a freedom of hand in sketching from nature, such as would be
found exceptional among pupils of our best training schools of art.
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
On this point my friend, Sir Noel Paton, writes me: “I entirely
concur in your view as to the immense superiority as works of art
of the engravings on horn and ivory found in the prehistoric caves,
over any modern work of the same kind which I have seen, executed
by the Eskimos or other savage, tribes of our own day. As
compared with the latter, the prehistoric productions are like the
swift and direct studies from nature of Landseer, compared with
the laboured scrawlings from memory of a rather dull schoolboy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have elsewhere drawn attention to the fact that some of
the drawings of the Perigord cave-men and their palæolithic
contemporaries, especially, among the latter, the Kesserloch
sketch of a reindeer grazing, are left-hand drawings.<a id='r85'/><a href='#f85' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[85]</span></sup></a> So far
as this class of evidence is of value, the examples from the
caves in the valley of the Vézère are exceptionally numerous.
There, it may be, a family, or possibly a tribe, dwelt, among
whom left-handedness prevailed to an unusual extent, along
with a degree of skill and dexterity, such as is frequently
found to accompany the instinctive use of the left hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this, as in other respects, the recovery of evidences of a
well-developed æsthetic faculty among the men of Europe’s
Mammoth and Reindeer period, furnishes materials for many
suggestive inferences; for we shall very imperfectly estimate
the significance of the primitive drawings so unexpectedly discovered,
if we regard them as no more than the pastimes of
those ancient cave-men, whose artistic ability they so unmistakably
reveal. They are rather to be classed with the
picture-writing of the American aborigines—including its
most advanced Mexican stage abundantly illustrated in Lord
Kingsborough’s folios,—as one of the primitive supplements of
language among uncultured races. As such it is a form of
visible speech, and an important step in advance of the stage
of gesture-language. The historical value of the palæolithic
drawings is indisputable. They furnish a record, more trustworthy
than any written chronicle, of the strange conditions of
life in a region familiar to us throughout the whole historic
period for its genial climate and social civilisation. It is in
this aspect, as a contemporary chronicling of current events,
that palæolithic art has its chief value. It furnishes a graphic
picturing of the habits of life, and of many of the attendant
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
circumstances of that remote period, recorded with such vivid
truthfulness, that we realise very definitely the character of its
long-extinct fauna, and, to some considerable extent, the occupations
and modes of life of the cave-men by whom they were
hunted, and in leisure hours were reproduced graven or carved,
on bone, horn, or ivory, or traced in free outline on slabs of
schist or other soft stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Viewed simply as examples of imitative art among a people
still in the rudest Stone age, the drawings are significant and
instructive. They furnish evidence of observation and artistic
capacity, and consequently of intellectual powers capable of
very different results from anything that could be realised in
the absence of all knowledge of metallurgy, or of anything
beyond the crudest appliances for developing mechanical skill.
The conditions of climate probably forbade any attempt at
agriculture. They were hunters, fowlers, fishers, subsisting
mainly, if not wholly, by the chase. They not only successfully
pursued the wild horse, the reindeer, and other swift-footed
herbivora, but assailed the cave-bear, the cave-lion, and
other formidable carnivora, as well as the huge rhinoceros and
the mammoth. They also made excursions to the sea-shore,
and no doubt left there shell mounds similar to those which
have been explored with such interesting results on the Danish
coast; and which have their New World equivalents on the
seaboards of Massachusetts, Georgia, and Florida, where at
certain seasons the Indians resorted to feast on the shell-fish.
From their drawings and carvings we not only learn this, but
also that they were not unfamiliar with the whale, the seal,
and other marine fauna. The presence of the whale and seal
in the same latitude as the reindeer need not surprise us. The
occupation of Europe by palæolithic man contemporary with
the <span class='it'>Elephas primigenius</span> and other extinct mammalia, belongs
to an era when the relative levels of sea and land, and the
relations of the Atlantic coast-line to the ancient continent,
differed widely from their present conditions. If the genial
current of the Gulf Stream then reached the shores of Europe,
its influence extended over areas very diverse from those now
affected by it. But the range of the fauna of that Palæolithic
era was a wide one. Tusks of the mammoth and antlers of
the reindeer occur in the Scottish boulder-clay; and the discovery
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
of skeletons of the whale far inland in the carse of
Stirling, accompanied in more than one case by implements
made of perforated stag’s horn, tells of the presence of the
Greenland whale on the ancient Scottish sea coast, while the
stag haunted its forests, and the Allophylian savage paddled his
canoe in estuaries marked for us now by old sea-margins that
preceded the last great rise of the land. Skulls and horns of
the elk occur in the Scottish peat-bogs, seemingly indistinguishable
from those of the <span class='it'>Cervus alces</span>, or North American moose.<a id='r86'/><a href='#f86' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[86]</span></sup></a>
As to the reindeer, not only are its remains found in Scottish
mosses and the underlying marl, but they have been dug up in
the ruined brochs, as at Cill-Trolla, Sutherlandshire, and Keiss
in Caithness. The favourite haunts of the Greenland whale
are in seas encumbered with floating ice; and when they were
stranded in the estuary of the Forth by a tide rising on a
shore-line now nearly thirty feet above the tide-mark of the
present day, the highlands of Scotland were capped with perpetual
snow, and great changes of level had still to occur. But
neither the whale nor the Eskimo retreated within the Arctic
circle because they could only be at home among polar ice and
snow. Remains of the whale in Scottish kitchen middens of
greatly more modern date show that it must have haunted
the Scottish shores when the temperature of the surrounding
ocean differed little from that of the present day. There is
preserved in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries a drinking-cup
fashioned from the vertebra of a whale, which was
found in a weem, or subterranean dwelling, on the Isle of
Eday, Orkney, along with implements of stone, horn, bone,
bronze, and iron; and other evidences of the presence of the
whale in the Scottish seas are of frequent occurrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the ivory of the narwhal and the rostungr, or walrus,
it was in use by Scoto-Scandinavian carvers after the disappearance
of the reindeer from Scotland. A curious large sword,
probably of the fourteenth century, at Hawthornden, near
Edinburgh, has the hilt made of the narwhal’s tusk; and the
famous Lewis chessmen, found at Uig in the Isle of Lewis, as
well as examples of chess and tablemen recovered from time to
time in other Scottish localities, are all made of the walrus
ivory, the “huel-bone” of Chaucer. But when the whale
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>
haunted the shores to which the hunters of the Perigord
resorted, it is doubtful if Britain was an island. In that age
of the mammoth and the reindeer of the Pyrenees, when art
flourished in the valley of the Vézère, and men, scarcely less
strange than the long-extinct fauna on which they preyed,
sheltered in their rock-dwellings from the ice and snow, the
relative levels of sea and land, and the lines of the Atlantic
coast, bore no relation to their present aspect; for the old region
of ice and snow was what is now familiar to us as the vine-clad
sunny land of France. All this we learn from the archæological
remains of those old times, and especially from the
carvings and gravings which, happily for us, were then
executed, whether for pastime or as actual records. Like
many of the native races of the American continent at the
present day, the old cave-dwellers employed their leisure time
in carving in bone, horn, or ivory; and like them too, as we
believe, they applied their skill in graphic art as a means of
recording events and communicating facts to others. The
broad palinated antlers of the reindeer, prepared sections of
mammoth ivory, and slabs of schist, all furnished tablets on
which they not only delineated the objects of the chase, but
incidents and observations of daily experience. And if so, we
have in such drawings the germ of ideographic symbolism, and
of hieroglyphic writing. By just such a process of recording
facts in a form readily intelligible to others, the early dwellers
in the Nile valley originated the mode of object-drawing and
ideographic chronicling, from which hieroglyphic, demotic, and
ultimately, phonetic writing were evolved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not solely by inference that we are led to surmise
that the ingenious draughtsmen of Southern France had a higher
aim than mere pastime in some, at least, of their graphic
devices. The relics recovered from the ancient caves include
what appear to be tallies and numerical records, unmistakably
indicative, not only of a method of numeration, but of the
growth of a system of mnemonic symbolism, and distinctive
graven characters, not greatly inferior to the primitive alphabets
of Celtic or Scandinavian lithology. It is curious, indeed,
to find in use in Europe’s early Post-Glacial period symbols
which, but for their undoubted execution by the ancient
cave-men of Aquitania, might be assigned with every probability
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
to some Druid scribe, familiar with the ogham characters
of the Gauls and British Celts. Among the objects recovered from
the Dordogne caves, including tallies and inscribed tablets of
horn and ivory, with their enumeration in simple units, M.
Broca specially noted a deer’s tyne, marked with a series of
notches, which he assumed to be a hunter’s memoranda of the
produce of the chase. A more complex record, found in the
rock-shelter of Gorge d’Enfer, is inscribed on a plate of ivory.
Its groups of horizontal and oblique lines along the edges, and
symmetrical rows of dots on the flat surface, combine to
furnish a record graven in characters as well-defined as many
a runic or ogham inscription. If it be no more than the
memoranda of a successful hunt, with a classification of the
different kinds of game secured for distribution among the
members of the tribe, it is not greatly inferior to the early
system of numeration among the Egyptians. But when such
a piece of arithmetic was supplemented by a pictorial record
of the hunt; or by the incident, so acceptable to a bevy of
hunters over their camp-fire, of the fight of the male deer in
the rutting season; or the charge of the enraged elephant with
elevated trunk, trumpeting wrath and defiance: much had been
accomplished that admits of comparison with records of the
modern penman.<a id='r87'/><a href='#f87' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[87]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult for the men of a lettered age, with all the
facilities of the printing-press in fullest use, to realise the
condition of intellectual activity, or the natural modes of its
expression, among an unlettered people. The transmission of
Homeric or Ossianic poems, of a Niebelungen Lied or an
Albanic Duan, from generation to generation, by the mere aid of
memory, is scarcely conceivable to us now. Yet I recall the
account given by Ozahwahguaquzuebe, an Ojibway Indian, who
told of his habitually accumulating his tobacco till he saved
enough to bribe an aged chief of the tribe to repeat to him,
again and again, in all its marvellous details, the legend of
Nanaboozo and the post-diluvial creation, in order that he
might be able, in his turn, to recount it in full, as it had come
down from elder generations of his people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are some results of the introduction of the printing-press
still very partially appreciated. Its direct influence on
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
social and intellectual progress receives ample recognition;
but not so all indirect influences traceable to its operations.
In elder centuries, before Gutenberg and Faust superseded
the labours of the scribe, not a few ballad-epics and lyrics
were consigned to the wandering minstrels, to whose tenacious
memories we are so largely indebted. But there were other
avenues in those old centuries for fancy and passion, not
greatly dissimilar to those by which the observation and
descriptive powers of the post-glacial Troglodytes found vent.
It is vain for a Pugin or a Ruskin to bewail the mechanical
character of modern art. It was easier for the mediæval
satirist to find free scope for his humour in a sculptured
corbel, or on a boss of the beautiful groined ceiling, or to
carve his grosser caricature within easy access under the
<span class='it'>miserere</span> in the choir, than to spend long hours at his lectern
in the scriptorium, committing his fancies with laborious pains
to less accessible parchments. And so, both satires and
sermons were then graven in stone, which now find utterance
in ways more suited to the age in which we live:—</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>For nature brings not back the Mastodon,</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor we those times.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Taste and fancy have now a thousand avenues at their command
for the humour and satire which mingled, in quaint
incongruity with the devout aspirations inwrought into
mediæval architecture. With the revival of learning, and the
introduction of the printing-press, came the Renaissance.
Europe renounced mediæval art as “Gothic.” Classic, or what
passed for classic art, ruled for the next three centuries.
Architecture became more and more mechanical; while
æsthetic taste sought elsewhere, and more especially in the
novel arena of the printing-press, for avenues where it could
sport in unrestrained freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ingenious skill of the palæolithic artists and tool-makers,
who wrought in their rock-shelters and limestone
caves, in that remote era when the climate along the northern
slope of the Pyrenees resembled that of Labrador at the
present day, has naturally awakened a lively interest. The
rigour of the climate during a greatly prolonged winter
prevented their obtaining stone or flint for purposes of
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
manufacture. They wrought, accordingly, in bone, in mammoth
ivory, and in the horn of the reindeer, fashioning from
such materials their lances, fish-spears, knives, daggers, and
bodkins; turning to account the deer’s tynes for tallies; and
carving out of the larger bones what are assumed to have
been maces or official batons, elaborately ornamented with
symbolic devices designed for other purposes than mere
decoration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimo are recognised as presenting the nearest type
to the cave-men of Europe’s Post-Glacial era. It is even
possible that, like the natives of Labrador, the latter may
have occupied winter snow-huts, and only resorted to their
cave-shelters during the brief heat of a semi-arctic summer.
This, however, is rendered doubtful by the occurrence of
reindeer horns and bones of young fawns, along with others
of such varying age as to indicate the presence of the
hunter during nearly every season of the year. Among a
people so situated the industrial arts are called into constant
requisition, alike for clothing and tools; and the experience
of the hunter directs him to the products of the chase for
the easiest supply of both. The pointed horn of the deer
furnished the ready-made dagger, lance head, and harpoon;
the incisor tooth of the larger rodents supplied a more delicately
edged chisel than primitive art could devise; and the
very process of fracturing the bones of the larger mammalia,
in order to obtain the prized marrow, produced the splinters
and pointed fragments which an easy manipulation converted
into daggers, bodkins, and needles. The ivory of walrus,
narwhal, or elephant is readily wrought into many desirable
forms, and is less liable to fracture than flint or stone; and
all those materials are abundant in the most rigorous winters,
when the latter are sealed up under the frozen soil. Implements
of horn or bone may therefore be assumed to have
preceded all but the rudest flint celts and hammer-stones
or unwrought missiles; and although, owing to the nearly
indestructible nature of their material, it is from the latter
that our ideas of primeval tool-making are chiefly derived,
enough has been recovered from contemporary cave deposits
to confirm the analogy of their arts to those of the hyperborean
workmen of the North American continent.
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The necessity which, to a large extent, determined the
material of the ancient workers in bone and ivory, was favourable
to the development of the imitative faculty. The
ingenious ivory and bone carvings of the Tawatins and other
tribes of British Columbia, of the Thlinkets of Alaska, and the
Eskimo, equally suffice, with the examples of European
palæolithic art, to show how favourable such material was to
the development of artistic feeling, which must have lain dormant
had the artificers been limited to flint and stone. The
same influence may be seen in operation in many stages of
art: as in massive but bald Gothic structures, such as St.
Machar’s Cathedral on the Dee, where the builders were
limited to granite, while contemporary architecture in localities
where good sandstone or limestone abounds is rich in
elaborate details; and, where the soft and easily wrought Caen
stone is available, runs to excess in the florid exuberance of
its carvings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ingenious artist of the Palæolithic era not only
ornamented the hafts of his tools and weapons with representations
of familiar objects of the chase, but is also accredited
with carving, on his mace or baton, symbolic emblems
expressing the rank and official duties of the owner. The
analogous practice of the Haidahs of the Queen Charlotte
Islands at the present day shows that there is nothing inconsistent
with primitive thought in the symbolic, significance
assigned to some of the carved batons; and, if so, we have
there examples of imitative art employed in a way which
involved the germ of ideographic graving or picture-writing.
The mere fact of pictorial imitation implies the interpretation
of its representations. Eskimo implements are to be seen in
various collections, as at Copenhagen and Stockholm, in the
British Museum, in those of San Francisco and the Smithsonian
Institution at Washington, ornamented with representations
of adventures incident to their habits of life. An Arctic
collection, presented by Captain Beechy to the Ashmolean
Museum at Oxford, furnishes interesting illustrations of the
skill of the Eskimo draughtsman. The carvings and linear
drawings represent, for the most part, incidents in the life of
the polar hunter; and this is so effectively done that, as
Captain Beechy says: “By comparing one with another,
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
a little history was obtained which gave us a better insight
into their habits than could be elicited from any signs or
intimations.”<a id='r88'/><a href='#f88' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[88]</span></sup></a> Mr. W. H. Dall figures in his <span class='it'>Alaska and
its Resources</span>, analogous examples of Innuit or Western
Eskimo art; and in an interesting communication by Dr J.
W. Hoffman to the Anthropological Society of Washington,
on Eskimo pictographs as compared with those of other
American aborigines, he figures and interprets similar
examples.<a id='r89'/><a href='#f89' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[89]</span></sup></a> One of these, copied from an ivory bow used
in making fire, which he examined in the Museum of the
Alaska Commercial Company of San Francisco, depicts three
incidents in the Innuit hunter’s experience. In one, the
hunter supplicates the <span class='it'>Shaman</span>, or native medicine-man, for
success in the chase; another group represents the results of
the chase; while the third records the incidents of an unsuccessful
appeal to another shaman. Another graving from the
same locality embodies the incidents of success and failure in
a prolonged hunting expedition. In their interpretation, Dr.
Hoffman was assisted by a Kadiack half-breed who happened
to visit San Francisco at the time. A design of the same
class copied from a piece of walrus ivory, carved by a
Kiatégamut Indian of Southern Alaska, records a successful
feat of the shaman in curing two patients. He is represented
in the act of exorcising the demons, who are seen just cast out
from the men restored to health by his agency. From the
interpretations thus given, it may be inferred that such
drawings as those described by Captain Beechy represent in
nearly every case actual incidents. The hunter celebrates his
return from a successful chase, his experience in the attempt
to propitiate the supernatural powers on his behalf, or any
other notable event, by recording the impressive incidents on
the handle of his hunting knife or his ivory bow, or even in
some cases on a tablet of walrus ivory; just as the enthusiastic
sportsman will at times enter in his journal the special
occurrences of the fox-hunt, or the more adventurous feats of
deer-stalking, or commission an artist to perpetuate them on
canvas. Incidents of exceptional skill or daring are no doubt
recalled, and listened to with eager interest by the home
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
circle in the Arctic snow-hut; and are confirmed in their
most thrilling details by appeals to such graven records.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The more durable material employed alike by the ancient
cave-dwellers of Europe and by the modern Innuit and
Eskimo, has secured their preservation in a form best calculated
to command attention. But similar graphic representations
of incidents and ideas are common to various tribes of
North American Indians. Throughout the wide region of the
old Algonkin tribes rock-carvings, such as that of the famous
Dighton Bock, abound. The same are no less frequent in the
South-West from New Mexico to California; while similar
pictographs are executed by the Ojibways in less durable
fashion on their grave-posts, or even on strips of birch-bark.
In like fashion, the Crees and Blackfeet of the Canadian
North-West adorn their buffalo-skin tents with incidents of
war and the chase, and blazon on their buffalo robes their
personal feats of daring, and the discomfiture of their foes.
In this way, the aboriginal draughtsman is seen in his pictorial
devices to aim at the like result with that achieved by the old
minstrel chronicler or the courtly herald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the ornamented handles of implements recovered from
the abodes of the ancient cave-dwellers of Europe, the most
notable examples are far in advance of any Eskimo carvings.
One of those, from the cave at Laugerie Basse, has been
repeatedly engraved. It is fashioned from a piece of reindeer’s
horn. The carver has so modified his design, and
availed himself of the natural contour of his material, as to
adapt it admirably to its purpose as the handle of a poignard.
It was apparently intended to include both handle and blade;
but probably broke in the process of manufacture, and was
flung aside unfinished. The design is a spirited adaptation to
the special requirements. The horns are thrown back on the
neck, the fore legs doubled up, and the hind legs stretched
out, as if in the act of leaping. Another finely finished
example of a dagger-handle, from Montastrue, Peccadeau de
l’Isle, figured by Professor de Quatrefages in his <span class='it'>Hommes
fossiles</span>, also represents the deer with its horns thrown back;
but from its fractured condition the position of the limbs can
only be surmised to have corresponded to the example from
Laugerie Basse. With those may be classed such carvings as
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
the pike, so characteristically represented on a tooth of the
cave-bear, recovered from a refuse heap in the cave of
Durntly in the Western Pyrenees, and other similar sports of
primitive artistic skill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such carvings had no other aim, we may presume, than
the decoration of a favourite weapon, or the beguiling of a
leisure hour. But they show the fruits of skill, and the
observation of a practised eye, by the ingenious workmen
whose drawings and etchings merit our careful study. Considerable
taste and still more ingenuity are exhibited by
many of the American aborigines, in their decorative
carvings, and the ornamentation both of their weapons and
dress. The characteristics of Eskimo art have been noted.
The Thlinkets of Alaska, lying on their western border,
manifest a like skill, making ladles and spoons from the horns
of the deer, the mountain sheep, and goat, and carving them
with elaborate ingenuity. They also work in walrus ivory,
fashioning their bodkins, combs, and personal ornaments with
varied ornamentation; decorate their knife-handles of bone,
their paddles, and other implements; and carve grotesque
masks, with much inventive ingenuity in the variety of the
design, though scarcely in a style of high art. But it is
interesting to note the different phases of this imitative
faculty. Some tribes, such as the Algonkins, confine their
art mainly to literal reproductions of natural objects; while
others, such as the Chimpseyans or Babeens, the Tawatins,
and the Clalam Indians of Vancouver Island, have developed
a conventional style of art, often exhibiting much ingenious
fancy in its grotesque ornamentation. This is specially
apparent in the claystone pipes of the Chimpseyans, in
carving which they rival the ingenious Haidahs of the Queen
Charlotte Islands in exuberance of detail. But while the art
has become conventional, where it is not displaced by imitations
of the novel objects brought under their notice in their
intercourse with Europeans its combinations are in most
cases referable to native myths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In many of the elaborately carved Chimpseyan pipes, their
special purpose seems to be lost sight of in the whimsical
profusion of ornament, embracing every native or foreign
object that has chanced to attract the notice of the sculptor.
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
Nevertheless, it may help us to do justice to the true aim of
the Indian artist, if we call to remembrance how much of
Christian symbolism was embodied in many a mediæval
sculpturing of what, to the unsympathetic observer, seem now
only conventional vines and lilies, or a mere fanciful grouping
of dragons and snakes, with apples, figs, grapes, and thorns.
This has to be kept in view while noting in the pipe sculptures
human figures in strangest varieties of posture, intertwined
with zoomorphic devices, in which the bear and the frog have
a prominent place; and, as will be seen, a mythic significance.
It is no less suggestive to note, alike in the Chimpseyan and
in the Tawatin and Haidah carvings, curious analogies to the
sculptures of Mexico, Yucatan, and Central America. This
resemblance has been noticed, independently, by many
observers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marchand, a French navigator who visited the Queen
Charlotte Islands in 1791, after having recently seen the
Mexican sculpture and paintings, formed the opinion that the
Haidah works of art could be distinctly traced to Aztec
origin.<a id='r90'/><a href='#f90' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[90]</span></sup></a> He remarks of their paintings and carvings: “The
taste for ornament prevails in all the works of their hands;
their canoes, their chests, and different little articles of furniture
in use among them, are covered with figures which might
be taken for a species of hieroglyphics; fishes and other
animals, heads of men, and various whimsical designs, are
mingled and confounded in order to compose a subject.
It undoubtedly will not be expected that these figures
should be perfectly regular and the proportions in them
exactly observed, for here every man is a painter and
sculptor; yet they are not deficient in a sort of elegance
and perfection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The imitative faculty thus manifested so generally
among a people still in the condition of savage life, shows
itself no less strikingly in the modern claystone carvings
of objects of foreign introduction. The collection formed
by the United States Exploring Expedition, and largely
augmented since, includes numerous carvings in which
representations of log and frame houses, forts, boats, horses,
and fire-arms, are introduced; and where cords, pulleys,
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
anchors, and other details copied from the shipping which
frequent the coasts, furnish evidence of a practised eye,
and considerable powers of imitation. To the unfamiliar
observer, the result presents, in many cases, a very
arbitrary and even incongruous jumble of miscellaneous
details. But, most probably, the native designer had, in every
case, a special meaning, and even some specific incident in
view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interest awakened by such manifestations of observant
accuracy and artistic skill among savage tribes is not diminished
by the fact that in nearly all other respects they are
devoid of culture. Notwithstanding the absence in most of
them of the very rudiments of civilisation, experience proves
that among the tribes to the west of the Rocky Mountains
distinguished by artistic capacity, there is an aptitude for
industrious and settled habits, the want of which is so noticeable
in the nomad tribes of the prairies. Their linear patterns
are often singularly graceful; and they employ colour lavishly,
and with some degree of taste, in decorating their masks,
boats, and dwellings. This is specially noticeable among the
Haidahs, in the different dialects of whose language we find
not only names for nearly all the primary colours, but also
the word <span class='it'>kigunijago</span>, “a picture.” The symbolical and
mythological significance of many of their carvings is indisputable;
while the affinities, traceable at times to the
ornamentation most characteristic of the architectural
remains in the principal seats of native American civilisation
in Central America, confer on them a peculiar interest
and value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The curiously conventional style of ornamentation of the
Haidahs of Queen Charlotte Islands is lavishly expended on
their idols, or manitous, carved in black argillaceous stone,
and on their council-houses and lodges. In front of each
Haidah dwelling stands an ornamented column, formed of the
trunk of a tree, large enough, in many cases, to admit of the
doorway being cut through it. These columns, or “totem-poles”
as they have been called, are, in some cases, sixty or
seventy feet high, elaborately carved with the symbols or
totems of their owners. The height of the pole indicates the
rank of the inmate, and any attempt at undue assumption in
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>
this respect is jealously resented by rival chiefs. The symbols
of their four clans—the eagle, beaver, dog-fish, and black
duck,—are represented in conventional style on the carved
house-pole, along with their individual or family totems. In
some cases boxes are attached to the poles containing the
remains of their dead. Dr. Hoffman, whose previous studies
in native symbolism and ideography specially prepared him
for the intelligent observation of such monuments, has
furnished an interpretation of their most familiar devices.
“When the posts are the property of some individual, the
personal totemic sign is carved at the top. Other animate
and grotesque figures follow in rapid succession, down to the
base, so that unless one is familiar with the mythology and
folk-lore of the tribe, the subject would be utterly unintelligible.
A drawing was made of one post with only seven pronounced
carvings, but which related to three distinct myths. The bear,
in the act of devouring a hunter, or tearing out his heart, is
met with on many of the posts, and appears to form an
interesting theme for the native artists. The story connected
with this is as follows:—Toivats, an Indian, had occasion to
visit the lodge of the King of the Bears, but found him out.
The latter’s wife, however, was at home, and Toivats made love
to her. Upon the return of the Bear, everything seemed to
be in confusion. He charged his wife with infidelity, which
she denied. The Bear pretended to be satisfied, but his
suspicions caused him to watch his wife very closely, and he
soon found that her visits away from the lodge for wood and
water occurred each day at precisely the same hour. Then
the Bear tied a magic thread to her dress, and when his wife
again left the lodge, he followed the magic thread, and soon
came upon his wife, finding her in the arms of Toivats. The
Bear was so enraged at this that he tore out the heart of the
destroyer of his happiness.”<a id='r91'/><a href='#f91' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[91]</span></sup></a> Dr. Hoffman found this myth,
with the corresponding carvings in walrus ivory, among the
Thlinkit Indians, who, as he conceives, obtained both the story
and the design for their ivory carvings from the Haidahs.
This appears to receive confirmation from the peculiar style of
art common to both.
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>But the decorations of the Haidah lodge-poles admit at
times of a much more homely interpretation. Mr. James G.
Swan, the author of an article on “The Haidah Indians,” in
Vol. XXI. of the <span class='it'>Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge</span>, in
a communication to the <span class='it'>West Shore</span>, an Oregon journal, thus
describes an Indian lodge and house-pole which attracted his
notice, owing to its carved figures, in round hat and other
European costume, surmounting the two corner-posts of the
lodge. He accordingly made a careful drawing of the whole,
which, as he says, “is interesting as illustrative of the grim
humour of an Indian in trying to be avenged for what he
considered an act of injustice a number of years ago. Bear
Skin, a somewhat noted Haidah chief, belonging to Skidegate
village, Queen Charlotte Islands, was in Victoria, when for
some offence he was fined and imprisoned by Judge Pemberton,
the police magistrate. Bear Skin felt very much insulted;
and in order to get even with the magistrate he carved the
two figures, which are said to be good likenesses of the Judge,
who in this dual capacity mounts guard at each corner of the
front of the chiefs residence. The gigantic face on the front
of the house, and the two bears on the two mortuary columns,
seem to be grinning with fiendish delight, while the raven on
top of one of the columns has cocked his eye so as to have a
fair look at the effigies beneath him. Bear Skin is dead, but
the images still remain. It has been suggested that they be
removed to Victoria, and be placed over the entrance to the
police barracks, to keep watch and ward like Gog and Magog
at the gates of old London city.” But, on the other hand, a
symbolical meaning appears to be most frequently embodied
in the Haidah devices; of which Mr. Swan reproduces various
illustrations, accompanied with native interpretations of them.
One drawing, for example, represents a grouping of conventional
patterns such as are common on the Haidah blankets of
goats’ hair, and in which the untutored student can discern
little more than confused scroll-work, with here and there an
enormous eye, rows of teeth, and a symmetrical repetition of
the design on either side of the central device. Yet, according
to Kitelswa, the native Haidah interpreter, “it represents
cirrus clouds, or, as sailors term them, ‘mares’ tails and
‘mackerel sky,’ the sure precursors of a change of weather.
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
The centre figure is T’kul, the wind spirit. On the right and
left are his feet, which are indicated by long streaming clouds;
above are his wings, and on each side are the different winds,
each designated by an eye, and represented by the patches
of cirrus clouds. When T’kul determines which wind is to
blow, he gives the word and the other winds retire. The
change in the weather is usually followed by rain, which is
indicated by the tears which stream from the eyes of T’kul.”
The difficulty with which the inexperienced observer has to
contend, in any attempt to interpret such native conventional
art, finds apt illustration in Mr. Swan’s account of an elaborately
sculptured lodge-pole of which he made a drawing at
Kioosta village, on Graham Island, one of the Queen Charlotte
group. When describing it in minute detail, he says: “I
could make out all the figures but the butterfly, which I
thought at first was an elephant with its trunk coiled up; but
on inquiry of old Edinso, the chief who was conveying me in
his canoe from Massett to Skidegate, he told me it was a
butterfly, and pointed out one which had just lit near by on a
flower.” The same characteristics have already been referred
to in describing the claystone carvings of the Chimpseyans.
They also mark the Haidah sculptures executed in the soft
argillaceous slate which abounds in their vicinity. But the
Haidahs work with no less ability in other materials; and
were familiar of old with the native copper, which is brought
from some still unascertained locality, it is believed, in Alaska.
The collections of the Geological Survey at Ottawa include
some of their beautifully wrought copper daggers and a massive
and finely finished copper neck-collar. They have now learned
to work with equal skill in iron. Their bracelets, rings, and ear
ornaments of gold and silver; their copper shields and richly
carved emblematic weapons, bows and arrows, iron daggers
and war knives; as well as their wooden and horn dishes,
spoons, masks, and toys, are eagerly sought after. The
carvings on them, when properly explained, are of great
interest; for every device has a meaning, and each illustrates
a story or a legend, readily understood by the Indian, but by
no means willingly interpreted to strangers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A knowledge of the myths of the Haidahs and other coast
tribes is indispensable to any interpretation of their carvings;
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>
and to those, accordingly, Dr. Hoffman has directed his
attention. “A very common object,” as he says, “found
carved upon various household vessels, handles of wooden
spoons, etc., is the head of a human being in the act of eating
a toad; or, as it frequently occurs, the toad placed a short
distance below the mouth. This refers to the evil spirit,
supposed to live in the wooded country, who has great power
of committing evil by means of poison, supposed to be extracted
from the toad”; but, as Dr. Hoffman adds, it is a
difficult matter to get an Indian to acknowledge the common
belief in the mythic being, even when aware that the inquirer
is in possession of the main facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interpretations thus furnished by a careful study of the
carvings of the Haidahs and other artistic native tribes of
British Columbia, and the evidence of a specific meaning and
application discoverable in their most conventional designs,
have a significant hearing on the study of analogous productions
of the cave-men of Europe’s palæolithic dawn. The
manifestations of an active imitative faculty and some degree
of artistic skill, among different rude native tribes of this
continent, present some striking parallels to the æsthetic aptitudes
of the primeval draughtsmen and carvers of Europe.
There are, moreover, undoubted resemblances in style and
mode of representation of the objects, as depicted on some of
the ancient and the modern bone and ivory carvings and
drawings of the two continents; but the latter exhibit no
evidence of progress. The Innuit and Eskimo designs do,
indeed, more nearly approximate to those of the primitive
draughtsmen than other aboriginal efforts; but their inferiority
in all respects is equally striking and indisputable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence of artistic ability in the native races both of
Central and Southern America is abundant; nor is the northern
continent lacking in its specially artistic race. But the
achievements of the ancient Mayas, Peruvians, or Mound-Builders,
are of very recent date, compared with the palæolithic,
or even the neolithic productions of Europe. It need not,
therefore, excite our wonder to find American antiquaries
welcoming a disclosure, only too strikingly analogous to the
famous mammoth drawing of the La Madeleine cave. There
recently issued from the American press a tastefully printed
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
volume, in which its author, Mr. H. C. Mercer, gives an
account of the discovery, near Doylestown, Pennsylvania, of a
“gorget stone” of soft shale, on which is graven what the
author describes as “unquestionably a picture of a combat
between savages and the hairy mammoth. The monster,
angry, and with erect tail, approaches the forest, in which
through the pine-trunks are seen the wigwams of an Indian
village.” The sun, moon, and the forked lightning overhead,
complete a design which could scarcely deserve serious notice,
so palpable is the evidence of the fabrication, were it not for
the unmistakable sincerity with which the author sets forth
the narration, and assures us that after the most careful
inquiry “nothing has occurred to shake his faith in the unimpeachable
evidence of an honest discovery.”<a id='r92'/><a href='#f92' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[92]</span></sup></a> The figure of
the mammoth has a suspiciously near resemblance, in all but
one respect, to the La Madeleine graving on mammoth ivory.
It charges its assailants with lowered trunk and erect tail;
but instead of presenting, as in the ancient cave-dweller’s
drawing, evidence of aptitude in the free use of the pencil or
graving tool, the scratchings on the Lenape Stone are crude
and inartistic, even if tried by the rudest standard of Indian
art. It may, perhaps, be worth noting that—if the design
has not been purposely reversed in order to evade comparison
with the genuine European example,—it is a left-handed
drawing. The forgery of palæolithic implements has become a
systematic branch of manufacture in Europe; and the “Grave
Creek Stone,” the “Ohio Holy Stone,” and other similar productions
of perverted American ingenuity are familiar to us.
It need not, therefore, excite any special wonder to find a like
activity in the production of fictitious examples of pictorial
art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But North America has its own ancient artistic race, which,
though claiming no such antiquity as that of Aquitaine, is, in
the primary sense of the term, essentially prehistoric. Among
the æsthetic productions of older races of the continent, the
carvings and sculptures of the ancient Mound-Builders of Ohio
not only admit of comparison with those of Europe’s primitive
workers in bone and ivory, but even, in one respect, surpass
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
them. For it is curious to observe that the palæolithic artists,
whose carvings and drawings manifest such a capacity for
appreciating the grace of animal form, and for reproducing
with such truthfulness objects and scenes familiar to them in
the chase, seem to have invariably failed, or at least shown a
surprising lack of skill, in their attempts to delineate the
human face and figure. Professor de Quatrefages notes of one
such carving: “M. Massénat has brought from Laugerie Basse
a fragment of reindeer’s horn, on which is graven a male
aurochs fleeing before a man armed with a lance or javelin.
The animal is magnificent; the man, on the contrary, is
detestable, devoid alike of proportion and true portraiture.”<a id='r93'/><a href='#f93' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[93]</span></sup></a>
Some beautiful Mexican terra-cotta human masks have been
preserved; and, amid the endless varieties of quaint and
whimsical device in Peruvian pottery, singularly graceful
portrait-vases occur. But, as a rule, even among the civilised
Mexicans, imitations of the human face and figure seldom
passed beyond the grotesque; and although the sculptors of
Central America and Yucatan manifested an artistic power
which accords with the civilisation of a lettered people, yet,
in the majority of their statues and reliefs, the human form
and features are subordinated to the symbolism of their
mythology, or to mere decorative requirements. In the
carvings of the old Mound-Builders, as in those of the vastly
more ancient artists of palæolithic Europe, we have to deal
with miniature works of art; but both include productions
meriting the designation. The variety and expressiveness of
many of the mound sculptures, their careful execution, and the
evidence of imitative skill which they furnish, all combine to
render them objects of interest. But foremost in every trait
of value are the human heads. In view of the accuracy of
many of the miniature sculptures of animals, it has been
reasonably assumed that they perpetuate no less trustworthy
representations of the workmen by whom they were carved.
Equally well-executed examples of contemporary portraiture,
recovered from palæolithic caves of Europe, would be prized
above all other relics of its Mammoth or Reindeer period.
Nevertheless, striking as is the character of the art of the
Aligéwi, it differs only in degree of merit from that of many
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
modern Indian races; and in some of the Algonkin stone-pipes
the human figure is carved with well-proportioned
symmetry. In such carvings, moreover, even when expended
on the decoration of the pipe,—which was employed among so
many native tribes in their most important ceremonial and
religious observances,—there is rarely anything to suggest a
higher aim of the artist than mere decoration. The same may
be assumed of the ancient carvers, in such work as they
expended on the hafts of the daggers found at Montastrue or
Laugerie Basse. But when a carefully executed linear drawing
occurs on a rough slab of schist, with its fractured edges left
untrimmed, as is the case in examples from the caves of Les
Eysies and Massat, the artist manifestly had some other
purpose in view; and this I conceive to have been the earliest
stage of ideography or picture-writing. He was communicating
facts in detail by means of his pencil which his best attempts
at verbal description would have failed to convey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Language is even now a very inadequate means of communicating
to others specific ideas of form; and some of the
most fluent lecturers in those departments of science, such as
geology, biology, and anthropology, in which there is a frequent
demand for the appreciation of details in form and structure,
habitually resort to the chalk and blackboard. Students of
my own earlier days will recall, as among their most pleasant
memories, the facile pencil with which the gifted naturalist,
Edward Forbes, seemed equally eloquent with hand and tongue;
and no one who enjoyed the lucid demonstrations of Agassiz
in the same fields of scientific research can think of him otherwise
than with chalk in hand. To the uncultured, yet
strangely gifted Troglodyte of the primeval dawn, language
was still more inadequate for his requirements; and hence, as
I imagine, the facile pencil was in frequent requisition for
purposes of demonstration, with ever-growing skill to the
practised hand. Professor de Quatrefages, who has enjoyed
unusually favourable opportunities for the study of those
productions, thus directs attention to their artistic merits: “The
art of the draughtsman, or rather of the engraver, almost constantly
applied to the representation of animals, was first tried
on bone or horn. They have attempted it on stone. The
burin must have been almost always a mere pointed flint.
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>
With this instrument, imperfect though it was, the Troglodytes
of the Reindeer age succeeded by degrees in producing results
altogether remarkable. The first lines are simple and more or
less vague. At a later stage they become more defined, and
acquire a singular firmness and precision; the principal lines
become deeper; details, such as the fur and mane, are indicated
by lighter lines, and even the shading is expressed by
delicate hatching. But what is nearly always apparent is a
sense of truthful realisation, and the exact copying of characteristics
which enable us often to recognise not only the order,
but the precise species, which the artist wished to represent.
The bear, engraved on a piece of schist which was found by
M. Garrigou in the lower cave at Massat, with the characteristic
projecting forehead, can be no other than the cave-bear,
the bones of which were recovered by that observer in the
same place. When we compare the drawings and anatomical
details of the Siberian mammoth with the engraving on ivory
discovered by M. Lartet at La Madeleine, it is impossible to
avoid recognising the <span class='it'>Elephas primigenius</span> which existed
throughout the Glacial period, and which has been recovered
entire in the frozen soil of Northern Asia. Oxen, wild goats,
the stag, the antelope, the otter, the beaver, the horse, the
aurochs, whales, certain species of fish, etc., have been found
recognisable with the like certainty. The reindeer especially
is frequently represented with remarkable skill. This may be
seen by the engraving found near Thayingen, in Switzerland.”<a id='r94'/><a href='#f94' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[94]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. de Quatrefages is disposed to estimate the artistic merit
of the carvings in ivory as even greater than that of the drawings
or etchings. But specific form and contour are more
easily realisable than their indication on a plane surface. To
do full justice to the wonderful skill of the Troglodyte draughtsman,
we must compare the most highly-finished paintings on
Egyptian temples and tombs with the works of their sculptors;
or even the perfect realisations of the Greek sculptors’ chisel,
with drawings on the most beautiful Hellenic vases. The
mastery of perspective, as shown in some of the works of those
palæolithic artists is remarkable when compared, for example,
with the Assyrian bas-reliefs; not to speak of the infantile
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
efforts of the Chinese on their otherwise justly prized ceramic
ware.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The potter’s art is at all times an interesting study to the
archæologist. We owe to Etruscan and Hellenic fictile ware
our sole knowledge of painting, contemporary with the most
gifted masters of the sculptor’s art. But it is in the form,
rather than the decoration, that the chief excellency of the art
of the potter consists. It is one of the plastic arts. The clay
in the hands of the skilled modeller is even more facile than
the pencil of the draughtsman; and the distinction between the
purely decorative sports of an exuberant fancy, and the purposed
symbolism of the carver or painter, is nowhere more
strikingly manifest than in the modellings of the ingenious
worker in clay. But fictile art belongs, for the most part, to
periods greatly more recent than that of the ancient Stone
age. Not that the work of the primitive potter involved such
laboriously accumulated skill as lay beyond reach of the palæolithic
carver and draughtsman; for clay cylinders from the banks
of the Euphrates, and the terra-cottas from the Nile valley,
carry us back to times that long antedate definite history.
But alike among the ancient cave-dwellers of Aquitaine, and
the modern Eskimo, the prevailing conditions of an Arctic or
semi-Arctic climate rendered clay, fuel, and other needful appliances
so rarely available, that among the latter, their pots and
lamps are fashioned for the most part of the <span class='it'>Lapis ollaris</span>, or
potstone. But traces of the pottery of many periods and races
abound, and furnish interesting materials for comparison. The
aptitude of the potter’s clay for a display of skill, alike in
modelling and in tracing on the surface imitative designs and
ornamental patterns, renders the fictile ware of widely different
eras a ready test of æsthetic feeling, as well as a trustworthy
guide to the age and race of its artificers. To the ancient
cave-men, to whose skill such carvings as the reindeer from
Laugerie Basse, or Montastrue, are due, modelling in clay
would have been as easy and natural as to the modern sculptor;
and pottery, if well-burnt, when not exposed to violence,
is little less durable than flint or stone. The rarity, or total
absence, of pottery among the contents of the palæolithic caves
accords with other indications of a rigorous climate. A piece
of plain earthenware was, indeed, recovered from the Belgian
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
cave of Trou de Frontal; and Sir W. Dawson, in his <span class='it'>Fossil
Men</span>, calls attention to the discovery, recorded by Fournal and
Christie, of fragments of pottery in the mud and breccia of
caverns in the south of France, along with bones of man and
animals, including those of the hyæna and rhinoceros. Those,
however, whatever be their true epoch, are mere potsherds,
valuable in so far as they indicate the practice of the potter’s
art at such a time, but furnishing no illustration of skill in
modelling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pottery found in graves of the Neolithic period is
mostly so imperfectly burned, that, however abundant it may
have been, it could scarcely leave a trace in the breccia, or
river gravel, from which the larger number of relics of palæolithic
man have been recovered. But the pottery and terra-cottas
which abound on the sites of Indian villages in North
America everywhere exhibit traces of imitative art, in the
efforts at modelling the human form, and the more or less
successful reproduction of familiar natural objects. Squier
remarks in his “Aboriginal Monuments of the State of New
York,” that “upon the site of every Indian town, as also
within all of the ancient enclosures, fragments of pottery occur
in great abundance. It is rare, however, that any entire
vessels are recovered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In general there was no
attempt at ornament; but sometimes the exteriors of the pots
and vases were elaborately, if not tastefully, ornamented with
dots and lines, which seem to have been formed in a very rude
manner with a pointed stick or sharpened bone. Bones which
appear to have been adapted for the purpose are often found.”<a id='r95'/><a href='#f95' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[95]</span></sup></a>
Ornamentation of a more artistic kind appears to have been
most frequently reserved by the native workers in clay for
their pipes, to which at times a sacred character was attached,
and on which accordingly they lavished their highest skill as
modellers and carvers. Some of the smaller articles of burnt
clay, however, which Squier denominates terra-cottas, were
probably fragments of domestic pottery similar to those hereafter
described among the relics of the ancient Indian town of
Hochelaga. One example of an ingeniously modelled pipe,
found within an enclosure in Jefferson County, New York, is
specially selected as a good illustration of Indian art. It is of
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
fine red clay, smoothly moulded, with two serpents coiling
round the bowl. “Bushels of fragments of pipes,” he adds,
“have been found within the same enclosure.” A carved stone
pipe, from a grave in Cayuga County, is described as fashioned
in the form of a bird with eyes made of silver inserted in the
head, and Mr. Squier notes of another specimen: “The most
beautiful terra-cotta which I found in the State, and which in
point of accuracy and delicacy of finish is unsurpassed by any
similar article which I have seen of aboriginal origin, is the
head of a fox. The engraving fails to convey the spirit of the
original, which is composed of fine clay slightly burned. It
seems to have been once attached to a body, or perhaps to a
vessel of some kind. It closely resembles some of the terra-cottas
from the mounds of the west and south-west. It was
found upon the site of an ancient enclosure in Jefferson
County, in the town of Ellisburg.” Again, in describing some
similar relics from the site of an old Seneca village in Munroe
County, he adds: “The spot is remarkable for the number and
variety of its ancient relics. Vast quantities of these have
been removed from time to time. Some of the miniature
representations of animals found here are remarkable for their
accuracy.”<a id='r96'/><a href='#f96' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[96]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The descriptions thus furnished of the traces of aboriginal art
in the State of New York closely correspond to the remains
recovered on the sites of ancient Indian villages in Canada.
A finely modelled clay-pipe, with a serpent twined round it,
and holding a human head in its jaws, now in my possession,
was dug up, along with numerous other clay-pipes, bone pins,
and other relics, in Norfolk County, on the north shore of
Lake Erie. I also possess casts of some ingeniously modelled
clay-pipes found a few years since in an ossuary at Lake
Medad, near Watertown, about ten miles west from Hamilton,
Ontario. This no doubt marks the site of an ancient town of
the Attiwendaronks, or Neuter Nation, who were finally conquered
and driven out by the Iroquois in 1635, when the little
remnant that survived was adopted into the Seneca nation.
Mr. B. E. Charlton, who explored the Lake Medad ossuaries,
after describing the human remains, along with large tropical
shells, shell-beads and other relics, adds: “With these were
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
found antique pipes of stone and clay, many of them bearing
extraordinary devices, figures of animals, and of human heads
wearing the conical cap noticed on similar relics in Mexico
and Peru.”<a id='r97'/><a href='#f97' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[97]</span></sup></a> Similar discoveries rewarded the researches of
Dr. Taché in the Huron ossuaries on the Georgian Bay,
examples of which are now in the museum of Laval
University.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the site of the famous Indian town of Hochelaga, the
precursor of the city of Montreal, detached fragments, in well-burnt
clay, including modellings of the human head and neck,
had been repeatedly found, before the recovery of larger
portions of the Hochelaga pottery showed that projections
modelled in this form within the mouths of their earthern pots
or kettles were designed to admit of their suspension over the
fire. Any projection within the mouth of the pot would have
answered the purpose of protecting the cord or withe from the
risk of burning; so that the moulding of it into the human
form furnishes an illustration of the play of the imitative
faculty under circumstances little calculated to call it forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The decoration of domestic pottery by the American Indian
workers in clay is greatly developed among the more southern
tribes. The ornamentation of a few prominent points, moulded
more or less rudely into human or animal heads, gives place
with them to the modelling of the vessel itself into animal
forms, or to its decoration, chiefly with human or animal
figures. Among the examples of native art in the National
Museum at Washington are two large vases, remarkable for
their elaborate workmanship, which were brought from
Mexico, by General Alfred Gibbs. They are figured, along
with other specimens of Mexican pottery and terra-cottas, in
Mr. Charles Rau’s account of the Archæological Collection of
the United States National Museum. They are there spoken
of as “two large vases of exquisite workmanship,” and one of
them is not only described as an admirable specimen of Mexican
pottery, but it is added: “As far as the general outline is
concerned, it might readily be taken for a vessel of Etruscan or
Greek origin. The peculiar ornamentation, however, stamps it
at once as a Mexican product of art:”<a id='r98'/><a href='#f98' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[98]</span></sup></a> and, it may be added,
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>
in doing so, places it in very marked contrast to any example
of Etruscan or Greek workmanship. Its modelling, both in
general form and in all its curious zoomorphic details, is
essentially barbarous, yet manifesting ingenious skill in the
workmanship, and exuberant fancy in design. The influence
of Mexican art extended northward; and its characteristics
may be traced in much of the native pottery of the Southern
States. But throughout Mexico, Central America, and the
Isthmus, the modeller in clay appears to have revelled in feats
of skill. Clay masks and caricatures, and heads of men and
animals, in endless variety of dress and fashioning, abound.
Utility is in many cases rendered altogether subsidiary to the
sports of fancy. Musical instruments are made in the form of
animals; and vases and earthenware vessels of every kind are
modelled in imitation of vegetables, fruit, and shells, or decorated
with familiar natural objects. This is still more apparent
in Peruvian pottery, where an unrestrained exuberance of
fancy sports with the pliant clay. Animal and vegetable
forms are combined. Men and women are represented in their
daily avocations, as porters, water-carriers, etc. Portrait-vases
represent the human head, characterised at times by grace and
beauty; but more frequently grotesquely caricatured. The
human head surmounts the lithe body of the monkey, sporting
in ape-like antics; melons and gourds have animal heads for
spouts; while the duck, parrot, toucan, pelican, turkey, crane,
land-turtle, lynx, otter, deer, llama, cayman, shark, toad, etc.,
are ingeniously reproduced, singly or in groups, as models for
bottles, jars, or pitchers. The double or triple goblets, and
two-necked bottles or jugs, acquire a fresh interest from resemblances
traceable between some of them and others belonging
to distant localities and remote ages. The Fijians, on the
extreme western verge of the Polynesian archipelago, have
already been referred to for their skill in the finished workmanship
of their implements, and of their pottery, some of
which suggest curious analogies to Peruvian types. But it is
more interesting to note the apparent reproduction of Egyptian,
Etruscan, and other antique forms in Peruvian fictile ware;
and to recognise on the latter the Vitruvian scroll, the Grecian
fret and other ancient classic and Assyrian patterns—not as
evidence of common origin, but as originating independently
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
from the ornamentation naturally produced in the work of the
straw-plaiter and weaver. Still more curious are their analogies
to ancient Asiatic art, as disclosed in a comparison with
many of the objects recovered by Dr. Schliemann on Homeric
sites. Among the relics which rewarded his exploration of the
site of the classic Ilios, are examples of double-necked jugs,
terra-cotta groups of goblets united as single vessels, along
with others terminating with mouthpieces in the forms of
human or animal heads; or modelled with such quaint
ingenuity to represent the hippopotamus, horse, pig, hedgehog,
mole, and other animals, that, were it not for the strange fauna
selected for imitation, they would seem little out of place in
any collection of Peruvian pottery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same exuberant sportiveness of the imitative faculty,
so characteristic of the races of the New World, reappears in
productions of the native metallurgists of Mexico and Central
America. Casting, engraving, chasing, and carving in metal,
were all practised by the Mexicans with a lavish expenditure
of misspent labour. Ingenious toys, birds and beasts with
moveable wings and limbs, fish with alternate scales of gold
and silver, and personal ornaments in many fanciful forms,
were wrought by the Mexican goldsmiths with such skill that
the Spaniards acknowledged the superiority of the native
workmanship over any product of European art. The ancient
graves of the Isthmus of Panama have yielded immense
numbers of gold relics of the same class, though inferior to
the finest examples described above. They include beasts,
birds, and fishes, frogs and other natural objects, wrought in
gold with much skill and ingenuity. The frog is made with
sockets for the eyes, an oval slit in front, and within each a
detached ball of gold, executed apparently in a single casting.
Balls of clay are also frequently found enclosed in detached
chambers in the pottery of the Isthmus. Human figures
wrought in gold, and monstrous or grotesque hybrids, with the
head of the cayman, eagle, vulture, and other animals, attached
to the human form, are also of frequent occurrence; though
in this class of works the modelling of the human form is
generally inferior to that of other animate designs. All of those
curious relics are found in graves, which, judging from the
condition of the human remains, are of great antiquity; if,
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
indeed, they do not point to the central cradle and common
source of Aztec and Peruvian art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is thus apparent that the imitative faculty, which manifests
itself in very different degrees among diverse races, was
widely diffused throughout the native tribes of the American
continent. But, while a certain aptitude for art is seen to be
prevalent among some of the rudest tribes, there were, no
doubt, among all of them exceptional examples of artistic
ability. There were the Jossakeeds and the Wabenos, skilled
in picturing on bark and deer-skin; and the official annalists
or “Wampum-keepers,” who perpetuated the national traditions.
Among the arrow-makers were some famed for their
dexterity in fashioning the hornstone or jasper into arrow
heads; and, while the art of the potter proved no less easy to
female hands than that of the baker, there were, doubtless,
among them some few rarely-gifted modellers, whose skill in
fashioning clay into favourite forms of imitative art won them
a name among the ceramic artists of their tribe. Pabahmesad,
the old Chippewa, of the Great Manitoulin Island, in Lake
Huron, famed for his skill in pipe carving, has been referred
to in illustrating the trade and manufacture of the Stone age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little remnant of the once-powerful Huron race now
settled on the river St. Charles, near Quebec, expend their
ingenious art on the manufacture of bark canoes, snow-shoes,
la-crosse clubs, basket-work, and moccasins. In this they show
much skill and dexterity; but among their most adroit workers
in recent years was Zacharee Thelariolin, who claimed to be
the last full-blood Indian belonging to the band. He manifested
considerable ability as an artist, had an apt faculty for
sketching from nature, and painted successfully in oil. A
portrait of himself, in full Indian costume, now in the
possession of Mr. Clint of Quebec, is a relic of much interest
as the work of an untaught native Indian, in whom the
hereditary imitative faculty thus manifested itself under
circumstances little calculated to favour its development. He
was sixty-six years of age when he executed this portrait.
Had it been his fortune to attract the attention of some
appreciative patron in early years he might have made a name
for himself and his people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another curious and exceptional example of native artistic
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
ability may be noted here. The studio of Edmonia Lewis, the
sculptor, has long been known to tourists visiting Rome. Her
history is a curious one. Her father was a Negro, and her
mother a Chippewa Indian. She was born at Greenbush, on
the Hudson river, and reared among the Indians till the age of
fourteen, both of her parents having died in her childhood. Her
Indian name was <span class='it'>Suhkuhegarequa</span>, or Wildfire; but she changed
it to that by which she is now known on being admitted to
the Moravian school at Oberlin, Ohio. After three years
schooling she went to Boston, where, it is said, the sight of
the fine statue of Franklin awoke in her the ambition to be a
sculptor. She sought out William Lloyd Garrison, and in
simple directness told him she wanted to do something like
the statue of the printer-statesman. The great abolitionist
befriended her. She received needful training in a local
studio, started an <span class='it'>atelier</span> of her own, and when I saw her in
Boston, in 1864, she was modelling a life-size statue emblematic
of the emancipation of the race to which she, in part,
belonged. Africa was impersonated, raising herself from a
prostrate attitude, and, with her hand shading her eyes, was
looking at the dawn. Soon after the sculptor went to Rome,
and she has there executed works of considerable merit. Her
most successful productions may be assumed to reflect the
artistic aptitudes of her mother’s race. Her two best works
in marble are “Hiawatha’s Wooing” and “Hiawatha’s Wedding.”
A Boston critic, in reviewing her works, says: “She
has always had remarkable power of manipulation, beginning
with beads and wampum, and rising to clay. She has fine
artistic feeling and talent, a sort of instinct for form and beauty
demanding outward expression.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wide diffusion of this imitative faculty and feeling for
form was no doubt stimulated by its employment for representative
and symbolic purposes. The relation of imitative
drawing to written language is equally manifest in the graven
records of the Nile valley and the analogous inscriptions of
Yucatan or Peru. Quipus, wampum, and all other mnemonic
systems, dependent on the transmission of images and ideas
from one generation to another, literally, by word of mouth,
have within themselves no such germ of higher development
as the picture-writing or sculpturing of the early Egyptians,
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
from which all the alphabets of Europe have been evolved.
The phonetic signs, inherited by us directly from the Romans,
seem so simple, and yet are of such priceless value in their
application, that it seems natural to think of the letters of
Cadmus as a gift not less wonderful than speech; since, by
their instrumentality, the wise of all ages speak to us still.
Plutarch tells, in his <span class='it'>De Iside et Osiride</span>, that when Thoth, the
god of letters, first appeared on the earth, the inhabitants of
Egypt had no language, but only uttered the cries of animals.
They had, at least, no language with which to speak to other
generations; nor any common speech to supersede the confusion
of tongues which characterised their great river valley,
bordering on Asia, and forming the highway from Ethiopia to
the Mediterranean Sea. The light thrown for us on the climate,
the fauna, the people, and the whole social life of Europe’s
Palæolithic era, by a few graphic delineations of its primitive
artists, suffices to show how the northern Thoth may have
manifested his advent among them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The condition of the Indian tribes in the North-West, in
British Columbia, and in the territories of the United States,
abundantly illustrates the effect of a multiplicity of languages
among nomad savages. The Blackfeet are in reality a political
and not an ethnical confederation, with at least three distinct
languages, and numerous dialects spoken among their dispersed
tribes. The same condition is found among the Kiawakaskaia
Indians, beyond the Rocky Mountains. In the confluence of
the nomad hunters to common centres of trade, speech accordingly
fails them for all purposes of intercommunication; and
travellers and fur-traders have long been familiar with the
growth of a common language at more than one of the chief
meeting-places of diverse tribes and races on the Pacific coast.
The Clatsop, in so far as it is native, is a dialect of the Cowlitz
language; but, as now in use, it is one of the jargons or “trade
languages” of the Pacific. But Fort Vancouver, long one of
the largest trading-posts of the Hudson Bay Company, has
been the special Babel where, out of the strangest confusion of
tongues, a new language has been evolved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The organisation of part of the territory west of the Rocky
Mountains into the province of British Columbia is rapidly
modifying the character of its native population. But in
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
recent years there were frequently to be found at Fort Vancouver
upwards of two hundred <span class='it'>voyageurs</span> with their Indian
wives and families, in addition to the factors and clerks.
Thither also resorted for trading purposes, Chinook, Nootka,
Nisqually, Walla-walla, Klikatat, Kalapurgas, Klackamuss,
Cowlitz, and other Indians. A discordant Babel of languages
accordingly prevailed; and hence the growth of a <span class='it'>patois</span> by
which all could hold intercourse together. The principal native
tribe of the locality is the Chinook, a branch of the Flathead
Indians on the Columbia river. They speak a language rivalling
that of the Hottentots in its seemingly inarticulate character.
Some of its sounds, according to Dr. Charles Pickering,
could scarcely be represented by any combination of known
letters; and Paul Kane, who travelled as an artist among them,
described it to me as consisting of harsh spluttering sounds proceeding
from the throat, apparently unguided either by the
tongue or lips. This language accordingly repelled every
attempt at its mastery by others. The Cree is the native
language most familiar to the traders, many of their wives
being Cree women. Both French and English are spoken
among themselves; while, in addition to the tribes already
named, natives of the Sandwich Islands, Chinese, and other
foreigners, add to the strange character and speech of this
miscellaneous community. Out of all those elements the
“Chinook jargon” or trade-language of the locality has
fashioned itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vocabularies of the Oregon or Chinook jargon have been
repeatedly published since 1838, when the Rev. Samuel
Parker made the first attempt to reduce it to writing. But
it is necessarily in an unstable condition, with local variations
and a changing vocabulary. The latest <span class='it'>Dictionary of the
Chinook Jargon, or Trade Language of Oregon</span>, is that of Mr.
George Gibbs, published by the Smithsonian Institution in
1863, and includes nearly five hundred words. When studied
in all its bearings, it is a singularly interesting example of the
effort at the development of a means of intercommunication
among such a strange gathering of heterogeneous races. In an
analysis of the various sources of its vocabulary, Mr. Gibbs
assigns about two-fifths of the words to the Chinook and
Clatsop languages. But in this he includes one of the most
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
characteristic elements of the jargon. The representatives of
so many widely dissimilar peoples, in their efforts at mutual
communication, naturally resorted to diverse forms of imitation;
foremost among which was onomatopœia. There are
such mimetic words as <span class='it'>he-he</span>, “laughter”; <span class='it'>hoh-hoh</span>, “to cough”;
<span class='it'>tish-tish</span>, “to drive”; <span class='it'>lip-lip</span>, “to boil”; <span class='it'>poh</span>, “to blow out”;
<span class='it'>tik-tik</span>, “a watch”; <span class='it'>tin-lin</span> or <span class='it'>ting-ling</span>, “a bell”; <span class='it'>tum-tum</span>,
“the heart,” from its pulsation; and hence a number of modifications
in which the heart is used as equivalent to mind or
will, etc. Again, varying intonations are resorted to in order
to express different shades of meaning, as <span class='it'>sey-yaw</span>, “far off,” in
which the first syllable is lengthened out according to the idea
of greater or less distance indicated. Many of their words, as
in all interjectional utterances, depend for their specific meaning
on the intonations of the speaker. Such utterances play so
small a part in our own speech, that we are apt to overlook
the force of the interrogative, affirmative, and negative tones,
and even the change of meaning that is often produced by the
transfer of emphasis from one to another word.<a id='r99'/><a href='#f99' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[99]</span></sup></a> But with
such an imperfect means of intercommunication as the trade
jargon, there is a constant motive not only to help out the
meaning by expressive intonation, but also by signs or gesture-language.
“A horse” for example, is <span class='it'>kuatan</span>; but “riding” or
“on horseback” is expressed by accompanying the word with
the gesture of two fingers placed astride over the other hand.
<span class='it'>Tenas</span> is “little” or “a child,”—in the latter case, accompanied
by the gesture suggestive of its size,—or it may mean
“an infant,” by the first syllable being prolonged to indicate
that it is very small. In addition to all this, words are
borrowed from all sources; and the miscellaneous vocabulary
is completed from English, French, Cree, Ojibway, Nootka,
Chihalis, Nisqually, Kalapuy, and other tongues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The late Paul Kane is my authority for some of the details
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>
of intonation and gesture-language. He brought back with
him a valuable collection of studies of the different races in
British North America; and, by means of the jargon, he
learned in a short time to converse without difficulty with the
chiefs of most of the tribes around Fort Vancouver. But as
an artist he was in constant use of his pencil; and, as he told
me, he frequently appealed to it, sketching himself, or at times
putting his pencil and note-book into their hands, with considerable
success in thus supplementing less definite signs.
The gesture-language furnishes Cheyenne, Dakota, Apache, and
other signs for “paint, colour, draw,” and “write”; the act of
writing or drawing being expressed by holding up the palm of
one hand and moving the forefinger of the other over it, as if
drawing. The jargon has also its word <span class='it'>pent</span>, “paint,” transformed
to a verb by prefixing the word <span class='it'>mamook</span>, “to do,
to make”; and its <span class='it'>tzum</span>, “painting,” or “mixed colours”;
<span class='it'>mamooktzum</span>, “to paint.” In the gesture-language of the
Dakotas and Apaches the equivalent sign is primarily indicative
of daubing the face with colour; but the tribes of the Pacific
coast paint their masks, boats, and houses in diverse coloured
devices, with some degree of taste. There is, therefore, reason
to look for terms expressive of the art in any language in use
among them; though the habitual employment of signs may in
some cases check the evolution of phonetic equivalents. But
among many tribes gesture-language has been systematised into
universally recognised pictographs, and so developed into a native
system of hieroglyphics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the Algonkin, Lenape, Iroquois, and other northern
tribes, and in the region comprising New Mexico, Arizona,
Colorado, and other south-western territory, rock-carvings and
pictographs abound. Wherever large surfaces of rock, or slabs
of stone, offer a favourable opportunity for such records, they
are found, at times executed with great elaboration of detail.
But less durable records are in use, dependent on the materials
most available to the scribe. The Algonkins and Iroquois
ordinarily resort to birch-bark; the Crees, Blackfeet, and other
prairie Indians, substitute the dressed skins of the buffalo;
while, as already noted, the tribes on the Pacific coast, as well as
the Innuit and Eskimo, employ deerhorn and ivory. In the
South-West, in the Sierra Nevada and Southern California, the
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
sculptured pictograph, after being incised on the surface of a
rock, or the wall of a cave, is frequently finished by colouring
in much the same way as was the custom with the ancient
Egyptian chroniclers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among a series of reports to the Topographical Bureau,
issued from the War Department at Washington, in 1850, is
the journal of a military reconnaissance from Santa Fé, New
Mexico, to the Navajo Country, by Lieutenant James K. Simpson
of the Corps of Topographical Engineers. His narrative is
accompanied with a map and illustrations of a remarkable
series of inscriptions, engraved on the smooth surface of a rock
called the Moro. They are of two classes, the native pictographs,
and also numerous Spanish inscriptions and devices;
one of which records the hasty visit of an old Spanish explorer
to the Moro Rock in 1606. The route of Lieutenant Simpson
lay up the valley of the Rio de Zuñi, where he met an old
trader among the Navajos, who was waiting to offer his services
as guide to a rock, upon the face of which were, according to
his repeated assertions, “half an acre of inscriptions.” After
travelling about eight miles, through a country diversified
by cliffs of basalt and red and white sandstone, in every
variety of bold and fantastic form, they came in sight of a
quadrangular mass of white sandstone rock, from 200 feet
to 250 feet in height. This was the Moro, or Inscription
Rock, on ascending a low mound at the base of which, the
journalist states, “sure enough here were inscriptions, and
some of them very beautiful; and although, with those we
afterwards examined on the south face of the rock, there could
not be said to be half an acre of them, yet the hyperbole was
not near so extravagant as I was prepared to find it.” The
inscriptions, some in Spanish, and others in, Latin, apparently
include examples nearly coeval with the conquest of this region,
by Juan de Onate, in 1595; and from their historical interest
they naturally received greater attention from the Topographical
Corps than the Indian hieroglyphics. But the same
locality was visited at a later date by surveyors appointed to
ascertain the most practicable route for a railroad to the Pacific
coast; and in a Report of explorations and surveys, published
by the Senate of the United States in 1856, Lieutenant
Whipple furnishes an interesting series of Indian hieroglyphics
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
or pictographs seen on his route. “The first of the Indian
hieroglyphics,” he remarks, “were at Rocky Dell Creek, between
the edge of the Llano Estacado and the Canadian. The stream
flows through a gorge, upon one side of which a shelving sandstone
rock forms a sort of cave. The roof is covered with
paintings, some evidently ancient; and beneath are innumerable
carvings of footprints, animals, and symmetrical lines.”<a id='r100'/><a href='#f100' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[100]</span></sup></a>
Examples of these are given; but of one series, the sketches
of which had been lost, Lieutenant Whipple remarks: “This
series, more than the others, seems to represent a chain of
historical events, being embraced by serpentine lines. First is
a rude sketch, resembling a ship with sails; then comes a
horse with gay trappings, a man with a long speaking-trumpet
being mounted upon him, while a little bare-legged Indian
stands in wonder behind. Below this group are several
singular-looking figures: men with the horns of an ox, with
arms, hands, and fingers extended as if in astonishment, and
with clawed feet. Following the curved line we come to the
circle, enclosing a Spanish caballero, who extends his hands in
amity to the naked Indian standing without. Next appears a
group with an officer, and a priest bearing the emblem of
Christianity.” The Pueblo Indians, who still worship the sun,
recognised in those picturings records of the thoughts and
deeds of their ancestors. They pointed to representations of
Montezuma, whom they still expect to return, and who is regarded
as a divine power; and recognised in the horned men a representation
of the buffalo-dance, from time immemorial a national
festival, at which they crowned themselves with horns and corn-shucks.
The drawing is in all probability an historical record
executed at a date not long subsequent to the first intrusion of
the Spaniards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lieutenant Whipple next describes the carvings found at
El Moro inscription rock where, he says, “Spanish adventurers
and explorers, from as early a period as the first settlement of
Plymouth, have been in the habit of recording their expeditions
to and from Zuñi.” He refers for those to Captain Simpson’s
report upon the Navajo expedition; but specimens of the
Indian drawings are given, which, he says, “are evidently
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>
more ancient than the oldest of the Spanish inscriptions.”<a id='r101'/><a href='#f101' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[101]</span></sup></a>
The latter are, for the most part, regular literal records in the
Spanish or Latin language, with names, and, in a few instances,
the date of their engraving. But the European epigraphists
appear at times to have borrowed the ideographic art of their
Indian guides, from the way several of their inscriptions are
accompanied with pictorial devices, or rebuses, somewhat after
the native fashion of writing. One, for example, which reads
<span class='it'>Pito Vaca ye Jarde</span>, has also the symbol of the <span class='it'>Vaca</span>, or “cow.”
Another group, consisting of certain initials interwoven into a
monogram, accompanied by an open hand with a double thumb,
all enclosed in cartouche-fashion, is supposed by the transcriber
to be, even more than the previous bit of pictorial symbolism,
a pictured pun. “The characters,” he remarks, “in the double
rectangle seem to be literally a sign-<span class='it'>manual</span>, and may possibly
be symbolical of Francisco Manuel, though the double thumb
would seem to indicate something more.” The Provincial
Secretary, Donaciano Vigil, after noting for Lieutenant Simpson
some data relative to the Spanish inscriptions, adds: “The
other signs or characters are traditional remembrances, by
means of which the Indians transmit historical accounts of all
their remarkable successes. To discover (or interpret) these
sets by themselves, is very difficult. Some of the Indians
make trifling indications, which divulge, with a great deal of
reserve, something of the history, to persons in whom they
have entire confidence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the summit of the cliff the ruins of a pueblo
of bold native masonry formed a rectangle of 206 feet
by 307 feet, around which lay an immense accumulation
of broken pottery of novel and curious patterns. At Los
Ojos Calientes, Lieutenant Simpson visited the <span class='it'>estuffas</span>,
buildings one story high, called the churches of Montezuma.
“On the walls were representations of plants, birds, and
animals; the turkey, the deer, the wolf, the fox, and the dog,
being plainly depicted; none of them, however, approaching
to exactness except the deer, the outline of which showed
certainly a good eye for proportion.” These are the work of
the Jemez Indians, who worshipped the sun, moon, and fire;
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
representations of which in circular form, and with zigzag
barbed lines for lightning, also occur on the walls.<a id='r102'/><a href='#f102' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[102]</span></sup></a> Lieutenant
Simpson remarks that he asked a Jemez Indian “Whether they
still worshipped the Sun, as God, with contrition of heart.”
His reply was: “Why not? He governs the World!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Hoffman figures and interprets a curious rock-painting,
copied by him from a granite boulder at Tulare river, California.
It covers an area of about twelve feet by eight; and the largest
figure is about six feet in length, and appears to be the work
of an advanced party of native explorers, intended for the
guidance of those who followed on their trail.<a id='r103'/><a href='#f103' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[103]</span></sup></a> Dr. Hoffman
also furnishes some interesting illustrations of the reproduction
of gesture-language in native pictographs preserved in the
Museum of San Francisco. Certain symbols are in very
general use. But the description of an Innuit drawing on
a slat of wood, as interpreted by a native, partly in his own
dialect, but largely supplemented by gestures, will best illustrate
this development of a system of picture-writing among a savage
people. A human figure directs his right hand to his own side,
while, with his left, he points away from him. This is the <span class='it'>Ego</span>,
the personal pronoun <span class='it'>I</span>. Again, a simple tracing of the like
figure, successively with a boat-paddle over his head; his right
hand to the side of his head; one finger elevated; his hand
stretched out in the direction indicated, with his harpoon,
or his bow and arrow, expresses his various actions. A spot
enclosed in a circle, and again a blank circle, mark the islands—inhabited
or uninhabited,—to which he is bound. A canoe,
with two persons in it, defines the number going and the mode
of transport; a phoca, or other animal, indicates the prey; and
the record closes with an outline of the house, or tent, towards
which the canoe is directed. The whole is equivalent to a
written memorandum left behind, to inform the members of
his family that he has gone in his boat to a particular island,
where he will pass the night,—the right hand to the side of
the head being a symbol of sleep. From thence he will proceed
to another island, where he purposes to catch a seal or
sea-lion, and then he will return home. It is in no degree
surprising to find that nearly the same symbols are in use by
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
widely different tribes; for, alike in their pictographs and
gestures, they naturally aim at the most familiar and literal
representations. The Eskimo and Alaskans represent death,
in their drawings and bone carvings, by the symbol of a
headless body, in nearly the same way as the Iroquois, the
Algonkins, and the Blackfeet. To this is added the spear, the
bow and arrow, or the gun, to indicate the mode of death by
violence. The ordinary symbol of sepulchral memorial is the
reversing of the totem and other objects pictured on the grave-post.
A succession of lines in rows or columns is the simplest
mode of primitive numeration, perpetuated among the Egyptians
even so late as the Ptolemaic dynasty. It appears to have
been in use among the cave-men of the Vézère in palæolithic
times, and is common to all such records. But in the Eskimo
and Indian pictographs the elevated hand, with one or more
fingers extended, serves for numeration; and where the
extended fingers and thumbs of both hands are represented
on an exaggerated scale, it signifies <span class='it'>multitude</span>. The native
gestures, drawings, and spoken languages, have indeed to be
studied together to understand fully the processes resorted to
for the expression and interchange of ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the philologist, the efforts at supplying equivalent terms
for objects and ideas common to the many diverse races furnish
a study full of interest. A Chinook or Clatsop word modified
to <span class='it'>saghalie</span>, signifying “above,” or “high,” is compounded with
the Nootka <span class='it'>tyee</span>, as the name of the High Chief, or God. <span class='it'>Elip</span>,
a Chihalis word, signifies “first,” or “before”; <span class='it'>tilikum</span>, Chinook,
is “people, a tribe,” or “band”; but the two words conjoined,
<span class='it'>elip-tilikum</span>, lit. “the first people,” is employed in reference to
a race of beings who preceded the Indians as inhabitants of
the world, just as we speak of the Antediluvians. <span class='it'>Ipsoot</span> is the
Chinook word for “to hide,” <span class='it'>ipsoot wau-wau</span> is “to hide one’s
speech,” <span class='it'>i.e.</span> “to whisper.” Or, again, <span class='it'>opitsah</span> is a modification
of the Chinook for “a knife”; <span class='it'>opitsah-yakka-sikha</span>, literally,
“the knife’s friend,” is “a fork.” The same word is also
applied to a sweetheart. Such economic use of words is
indeed by no means rare. But this branch of the subject
lies apart from the aim of the present paper. It may be
noted, however, in passing, that many of the jargon words,
according to Mr. Gibbs, “have been adopted into ordinary
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
conversation in Oregon, and threaten to become permanently
incorporated as a local addition to the English.” Mr. Horatio
Hale, long ago, stated as a result of his own observations, at an
earlier date: “There are Canadians and half-breeds married to
Chinook women, who can only converse with their wives in this
speech; and it is the fact, strange as it may seem, that many
young children are growing up to whom this factitious language
is really the mother-tongue, and who speak it with more readiness
and perfection than any other.”<a id='r104'/><a href='#f104' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[104]</span></sup></a> As to grammar, the
jargon has no more than the inevitable rudiments involved in
the necessity for expressing in some way ideas relating to time
and number; and in these directions there is frequent resort
to signs. But this, which accords with the first stage of picture-writing,
is true of the speech of many Indian tribes. Their
gesture-language is being reduced to the equivalent of a
vocabulary, and is much more copious than that of the Oregon
jargon. In 1880 the United States Bureau of Ethnology
issued “A Collection of the gesture-signs and signals of
the North American Indians”; and although this was only
designed as a preliminary step towards the complete elucidation
of the subject, it suffices to show how important a part signs
and gestures play in the dialogue of many rude tribes. The
Arapahoes, for example, according to Burton, “possess a very
scanty vocabulary, and can hardly converse with one another
in the dark. To make a stranger understand them they must
always repair to the camp-fire for pow-wow.”<a id='r105'/><a href='#f105' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[105]</span></sup></a> We are not
without some due appreciation, even now, of the eloquence of
action, as well as of speech, in the effective orator; and Charles
Lamb, in one of the <span class='it'>Essays of Elia</span>, aptly reminds us how
much even ordinary dialogue owes to expression for its full
effect. Candle-light, “our peculiar and household planet,” is
the theme of the quaint humorist. “Wanting it,” he says,
“what savage unsocial nights must our ancestors have spent,
wintering in caves and unillumined fastnesses! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What
repartees could have passed, when you must have felt about
for a smile, and handled a neighbour’s cheek to be sure that he
understood it?” And so the grave humorist goes on to picture
the privations of a supper party in “those unlanterned nights.”
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Indian, in many cases, resorts to the pencil, or its
equivalent, for the elucidation of subjects in which language
fails him. He will take a burnt stick and draw a map
indicating the route that has to be taken, the portages on a
river, or the trail through the forest, after he has failed by signs
and gestures to convey his meaning; and he can interpret
with ease the drawings of Indians of other tribes. When
camping out on the Nepigon River in 1866, with Indian
guides from the Saskatchewan, who were strangers to the
locality, they interpreted the drawings or carvings on a soft
metamorphic rock overlaid by the syenite of that district;
and were able thereby to tell us who had preceded them, and
to determine the route we should take. Lieutenant Whipple
in the narration of his route near the thirty-fifth parallel,
remarks: “Near the Llano Extacado were seen Pueblo
Indians from San Domingo. After an introductory smoke
they became quite communicative, furnishing curious information
as to their traditions and peculiar faith. When questioned
regarding the numbers and positions of the Pueblos in
New Mexico, they rudely traced upon the ground a sketch
from which a map of the country is reproduced in the Government
Reports.”<a id='r106'/><a href='#f106' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[106]</span></sup></a> The Rev. Dr. O’Meara, for many years a
missionary among the Ojibway Indians of Lake Superior, thus
writes to me: “The Indians were always pictorial, even in
common conversation, <span class='it'>i.e.</span> they liked to explain what they
meant by making figures; and always, if you asked one of
them for information as to the route to any place, he would
make a rough map of it, either on the sand or on a piece of
birch-bark.” This fully accords with my own experience. I
have repeatedly seen Indian guides take a piece of birch-bark
and indicate on it some idea otherwise inexpressible from our
ignorance of any common language. Their map-making must
be familiar to all who have travelled much with Indian guides.
They delineate with much accuracy the leading geographical
features of any familiar locality. I have in my note-books
sketches made by Indians, when I have placed the pencil
in their hand, and indicated by signs some information I
desired to obtain, about game, fishing, or other matters familiar
to them; or about their own tribal relationships, which they
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>
generally express in totemic fashion by their symbolic bear,
deer, beaver, eagle, turtle, or other animal. Such signs of the
clan, tribe, or nation are familiar to every Indian, as well as
the ideographs of his own and others’ names; and when
represented on the roll of birch-bark, painted on the chiefs
buffalo robe, or inverted on his grave-post, they can be interpreted
with the same facility with which an heraldic student
discerns the family history on the painted hatchment or the
sculptured shields of some noble mausoleum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By an alphabet, strictly so called, we understand a series
of symbols which have become the conventional equivalents to
the eye of the sounds which combine to form the speech of a
people. But <span class='it'>alpha</span>, <span class='it'>beta</span>, etc., were undoubtedly, in their first
stage, pictures, and not arbitrary signs; though they passed
undesignedly into the demotic characters of the Egyptian
current hand, and were then transformed, from ideographic
and syllabic characters, into the true phonetics out of which
have come the later alphabets of the civilised world. Egypt
is justly credited with the origination of a system of writing
which lies at the foundation of all our inherited knowledge,
and which, as Bacon says, “makes ages so distant to participate
of the wisdom, illuminations and inventions, the one of
the other.” Yet the germ of all this lay in the graphic
records of the palæolithic cave-men; and the very same
process of evolution from pure pictorial representation to
picture-writing or ideography, and so to arbitrary hieroglyphic
signs, or word-writing, is seen in the graven records of Copan
or Palenque, and on the ancient monuments of the Nile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is replete with interest thus to turn aside from the Old
World, with all its wealth of intellectual progress associated
with the letters of Cadmus, and find that in the western
hemisphere the human mind has followed the very same path
in its struggle towards the light. Longfellow, in his “Song of
Hiawatha,” has interwoven Algonkin and Iroquois legends into
a national epic, in which the elements of Indian progress are
all traced to this mythic benefactor, subsequently identified by
Mr. Horatio Hale, in his <span class='it'>Book of Iroquois Rites</span>, with a wise
Onondaga chief of the fifteenth century. But, tracing in
legendary fashion the early steps of Indian progress, the poet
represents the mythic reformer mourning how all things perish
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>
and pass into oblivion. Even the great achievements and the
traditions of their people fade away from the memory of the
old men. And so he inaugurates the method of recording
events, which in reality we recognise as the natural product of
the human mind in the exercise of that imitative faculty which
the discoveries of comparatively recent years have revealed to
us as in full activity among the men of Europe’s remote Post-Glacial
era. With his paints of diverse colours he depicts on
the smooth birch-bark simple figures and symbols, such as are
to be seen graven on hundreds of rocks throughout the North
American continent, and are in constant use by the Indian in
chronicling his own deeds on his buffalo robe, or recording
those of the deceased chief on his grave-post. The result is a
simple process of picture-writing, readily translatable, with
nearly equal facility, into the language of every tribe. Deeds
of daring against Indians or white men are set forth by the
native chronicler, and the rivals are clearly indicated by means
of their characteristic costume and weapons. Headless figures
are the symbols of the dead; scalps represent his own special
victims; and in like manner incidents of the chase, or feats
against the buffalo or grizzly bear, are recorded in graphic
picturings, which are as intelligible as any monumental
inscription of ancient or modern times. The description in
Longfellow’s Indian epic of the celestial and terrestrial symbols,
in actual use as Algonkin and other aboriginal hieroglyphics,
would answer, with slight modification, for those still to be
seen on the walls of Egyptian temples and catacombs: —</p>

<p class='line0'>Waving lines descending from it.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The picture-writing of the Aztecs, though greatly improved
in execution, and simplified by abbreviations, was the same in
principle as that of the rude northern tribes. The recognised
signs of the months and days of their calendar are not greatly
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
in advance of Indian symbolism; while some of their pictorial
records are as definite pieces of literal representation as the
battle of the reindeer from the Dordogne cave, or the
peaceful grazing scene recovered from a Swiss grotto near
Thayingen. One example of such a pictorial chronicling of an
important event has been repeatedly described, and aptly
illustrates its practical application. When Cortez held his
first interview with the emissaries of Montezuma, one of the
attendants of Teuhtlile, the chief Aztec noble, was observed
sketching the novel visitors, their peculiar costumes and arms,
their horses and ships; and by such means a report of all that
pertained to the strange invaders of his dominion was transmitted
to the Aztec sovereign. The skill with which every
object was delineated excited the admiration of the Spaniards.
But however superior this may have been as a piece of art, it
was manifestly no advance on the principle of Indian picture-writing;
nor can we be in much doubt as to its style of
execution, since Lord Kingsborough’s elaborate work furnishes
many facsimiles of nearly contemporary Mexican drawings.
In the majority of these, the totemic symbols, and the representations
of individuals by means of their animal or other
cognomens, are abundantly apparent. The specific aim of the
artist has to be kept in view. The figures are for the most
part grotesque, from the necessity of giving predominance to
the special feature in which the symbol is embodied. To the
generation for which such were produced, the connection
between the sign, and the person or thing signified, would be
manifest; and as a mnemonic aid, supplemented by verbal
descriptions of the trained official registrars, the record would
be ample. But a brief interval suffices to render such abbreviated
symbols obscure, if not wholly unintelligible; and
within less than a century after the Conquest, De Alva could
not find more than two surviving Mexicans, both very aged,
who were able to interpret the native pictorial records.
Nevertheless a system of picture-writing, originating among
the rude forest tribes with the simple employment of the
imitative faculty in the representation of familiar objects, with
their associated ideas, had advanced on this continent to the
very same stage from which, in ancient Egypt, the next step
was taken, resulting in the evolution of a phonetic alphabet,
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
and so of all that is implied in letters in the largest
sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this grand aim of ideography, or an equivalent of written
speech, may, as it appears to me, be traced the earliest efforts
at drawing and painting, reaching back to that strange dawn
of intellectual vigour revealed to us in the graphic art of the
men of Europe’s Palæolithic age. The same effort at written
speech underlies all the manifestations of the artistic faculty,
common alike to the semi-civilised and to the barbarous native
races of this continent; and in the terms by which they
express the graphic art in their various dialects, the common
significance of drawing and writing is generally apparent.
But the æsthetic faculty was thus stimulated into activity with
results which tended to develop art in all its forms of carving,
modelling, sculpture, and painting. An appreciation of colour,
not merely for personal adornment, but in its artistic application—alike
as a decorative art, and as the means whereby
natural objects can be presented with vivid truthfulness to the
eye,—is widely diffused; though the mastery of form by the
modeller or sculptor long precedes that of chiaroscuro, or aerial
perspective. Aboriginal painting is crude, consisting mainly of
colour without tone or shading, even where the drawing is
correct. But paints and dyes, both of mineral and vegetable
origin, are largely in use by many Indian tribes. The Eskimo
execute tasteful patterns on their skin robes in diverse colours;
and the northern tribes both to the east and west of the Rocky
Mountains dye porcupine quills and grasses, and with them
work ornamental patterns on their dresses and in basket-work.
The pottery of the Pueblo Indians is elaborately decorated in
colours; and in various other ways—as in the colouring of their
masks, and the painting of their boats and houses, by the
Indians of Oregon and British Columbia,—the native taste for
colour is manifested. Mr. Hugh Martin, in a communication
of an early date to the American Philosophical Society, gives
an account of the principal dyes employed by the North
American Indians.<a id='r107'/><a href='#f107' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[107]</span></sup></a> The Shawnees obtained a vegetable red,
which they called <span class='it'>hau-ta-the-caugh</span>, from the root of a marsh
plant, and largely used it in dyeing wool, porcupine quills, and
the white hair of deers’ tails. From another root, the <span class='it'>Radix</span>
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
<span class='it'>flava</span>, a bright yellow was obtained, by mixing which with the
red an orange tint is made. But they also extracted a rich
orange colour from the Poccon root. A fine vegetable blue is
also easily procured, and this was transformed to green by
means of a yellow liquor of the smooth hickory bark. Black,
which is much in demand, was obtained both from the sumack
and from the bark of the white walnut. All the colours thus
far named are vegetable dyes, but mineral colours are in
general use for painting, and especially for personal decoration,
which is no doubt the primary idea associated in the Indian
mind with the verb “to paint.” The Lenapes, Dr. Brinton
remarks, “obtained red, white, and blue clays, which were in
such extensive demand that the vicinity of those streams in
Newcastle County, Delaware, which are now called White
Clay Creek and Red Clay Creek, are widely known to the
natives as <span class='it'>Walamink</span>, ‘the place of paint.’ ”<a id='r108'/><a href='#f108' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[108]</span></sup></a> The Shawnees
applied the name <span class='it'>Alamonee-sepee</span>, “Paint Creek,” to the stream
which falls into the Scioto close to Chilicothe. The word
<span class='it'>walamen</span>, signifying “to paint,” is the Shawnee <span class='it'>alamon</span>, and
the Abnaki <span class='it'>wramann</span>, the <span class='it'>r</span> being substituted for the <span class='it'>l</span>.
Roger Williams, describing the New England Indians, speaks
of “<span class='it'>wunnam</span>, their red painting, which they most delight in,—both
the bark of the pine, as also a red earth.” The word is
derived from Narr. <span class='it'>wunne</span>, Del. <span class='it'>wulit</span>, Chip. <span class='it'>gwanatseh</span>:
“beautiful, handsome, good, pretty,” etc. “The Indian who
had bedaubed his skin with red ochreous clay, was esteemed
in full dress, and delightful to look upon. Hence the term
<span class='it'>wulit</span>, ‘fine, pretty,’ came to be applied to the paint itself.”<a id='r109'/><a href='#f109' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[109]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>A review of the terms of art in the diverse aboriginal
vocabularies would furnish an interesting supplement to the
general question of the manifestation of an artistic faculty, and
the evidences of appreciation of art among savage races. I note
a few illustrations, which the languages of some Northern
Indian tribes supply, of the ideas associated in the native
mind with terms of art. The Algonkin languages generally
have no distinctive words clearly discriminating between
painting, drawing, and writing in the sense of ideography;
though the inevitable tendency to invent or appropriate words,
as equivalents expressive of any novel object or idea, is in
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>
operation in those as in other languages. The Ojibways have
no generic term for painting the body or face, but express it
by some word connected with the specific colour in use. For
example, the painting the face black, as is done to a youth on
attaining puberty, is <span class='it'>muhkuhdaekawin</span>. This consists of <span class='it'>muh-kuh-da</span>,
meaning “black,” <span class='it'>eka</span>, the form which gives it the
verbal significance, “he makes himself black,” with the
termination <span class='it'>win</span>, constituting the whole a noun. So <span class='it'>misquah</span>,
“red,” is the root of <span class='it'>misquah-ne-ga-zoo</span>, “he is painted red”;
<span class='it'>misquah-ne-gah-da</span>, “it is painted red.” <span class='it'>Oozahwah</span>, “yellow,”
gives <span class='it'>oo-zah-we-ne-gah-zoo</span>, “he is painted yellow”; with the
corresponding terminal change for the neuter. But the word
<span class='it'>oozahnamahne</span>, from <span class='it'>oonah</span>, “the cheek,” is also used for
painting the face either red or yellow. <span class='it'>Quahnaiy</span>, or <span class='it'>gwanai</span>,
the word for “beautiful,” is applied to moral as well as physical
beauty, <span class='it'>e.g.</span> <span class='it'>gwanaienene</span> would be used of a fair, honourable
dealing man, as well as of one who was handsome or good-looking.
But such rhetorical tropes are common to many
languages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was indebted to the late Silas T. Rand, for upwards of
thirty years a missionary among the Micmac Indians of Nova
Scotia, for the following illustrative details: “The Micmac is
rich in words relating to art, the making and ornamenting of
garments, moccasins, snow-shoes, etc., of weapons and implements
for domestic use, making pottery and modelling in clay. For
building and managing a canoe there are at least seventy-six
words. They have words for carving on stone, and also on
wood, for marking dressed skins with flower patterns, for
carving flowers in stone, for scraping them on birch-bark dishes,
for drawing a likeness, making models and patterns, and for
working after them. When I was engaged in translating
Exodus, and largely dependent on my Indian teacher for the
words to express all the parts of the Tabernacle, its coverings
and furniture, mortices, tenons, hooks, fillets, loops, bars, pins,
sockets, etc., I fully expected to be baffled. What was my
surprise to find that there were words in the language by which
to express all I needed. Boards, bars, bolts, pillars, poles,
rings, everything was made, put together, and my ‘pundit’ an
excellent mechanic, when he returned next day to go on with
our work, assured me that he had been dreaming about that
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>
‘wigwam’ we had been erecting the previous day, and he was
sure he could make such a one. He had the pattern in his
head as clearly as Moses had it, after he had seen it up the
mountain.” In the Micmac, <span class='it'>aweekum</span> is “a drawing,” lit.
“I write it,” “I draw it”; <span class='it'>essum</span>, “I colour it”; <span class='it'>elapskudaaga</span>,
“I am carving,” or “cutting stone”; <span class='it'>elapskudaam</span>, “I am
carving it in stone”; <span class='it'>apsk</span>, which here denotes “stone,” is only
used in composition; <span class='it'>coondow</span> is the word for “stone”;
<span class='it'>eloksowa</span>, “I am carving in wood”; <span class='it'>noojeweekuga</span>, “a painter,”
“drawer,” “writer,” lit. “a maker of marks”; <span class='it'>aweegasik</span>, “a
picture,” lit. “it is marked down,” etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Algonkin root <span class='it'>walam</span>, “red,” is the term employed in
the <span class='it'>Walum Olum</span>, or “Red Score of the Lenape,” which was
brought under the notice of the New York Historical Society,
in 1848, by Mr. E. G. Squier, as <span class='it'>The Bark Record of the
Lenni-Lenape</span>. His narrative has been more than once reprinted;
but the carefully edited version of this curious Indian
ideograph given by Dr. Brinton, in his <span class='it'>Lenape and their
Legends</span>, will supersede earlier and less accurate versions.
The full translation with which the pictographic record of the
<span class='it'>Walum Olum</span> is accompanied, abundantly suffices to prove
that it may be most correctly described as a series of mnemonic
signs employed for the purpose of keeping in memory a
national chant, of a class very familiar to the students of
primitive history. The ballad-epics of the ancient Germans,
and the still earlier lays of ancient Rome, the Abanic Duan,
and others of the genealogical and historical poems of the
Celtic nations, were all of this class; and analogous traditionary
chants have been perpetuated among the Maoris of New
Zealand. The system of pictography corresponds to that in
use among the Ojibways and other Algonkin tribes, including
the totems, or sign-names; but it falls far short of true picture-writing.
Section IV. records the conquest by the Lenape tribe,
of the northern country, which they call “The Snake Land.”
Bald Eagle, Beautiful Head, White Owl, Keeping Guard, Snow
Bird, and a succession of other chiefs are named, all of whom
are more or less graphically indicated by their totems; but a
paraphrastic interpretation accompanies them setting forth ideas
that have no pictorial representation. Then comes a horizontal
line with ten oblique lines rising from it, and three cross-lines
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>
below, with the interpretation: “After the Seizer there were
ten chiefs and there was much warfare south and north.” Next
follows another succession of chiefs, each symbolised with some
associated idea. Thus a group of six small circles, arranged
upright in two columns, is surmounted by a larger circle, with
three oblique lines rising from the top. This is paraphrased:
“After him, Corn-Breaker was chief, who brought about the
planting of corn.” It is not difficult to imagine in the
drawing the conventional representation of an ear of corn; but
the major idea can be no more than one suggested to the
memory by association. In some instances the picture-writing
is more manifest. A horizontal line surmounted by two <span class='it'>téepees</span>,
or buffalo-skin tents, is “the buffalo land.” In one group, a
semicircle with radiating lines, placed on a straight line, is
translated: “Let us go together to the east, to the sunrise.”
In another case, nearly the same symbol—assumed, no doubt,
to represent the sun setting in the ocean,—is rendered, “at the
great sea.” It is, indeed, a system of picture-writing; but
instead of being abbreviated into word-symbols, it is reduced
to mere catch-words or mnemonic signs. Their value would be
unquestionable as an aid to memory in the perpetuation of a
mythic or historical poem; but, if the tradition were lost, they
embody no sufficient record from which to recover it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither the Iroquois nor the Algonkin nation can be
pointed to as specially gifted with imitative powers, or in other
ways furnishing evidence of any highly developed artistic
faculty. They cannot compare in this respect with the Zuñi,
or others of the Pueblo Indians, among whom the arts of long-settled,
agricultural communities have been developed for
purposes of ornament as well as utility; nor is their inferiority
less questionable when we compare them with some of the
barbarous tribes of the north-west coast, and the neighbouring
islands. Their languages confirm this; for while, as Mr.
Cushing has shown, the Zuñi language possesses many words
relating to art-processes, the Iroquois and Algonkin dialects
supply such terms, for the most part, in descriptive holophrasms,
and not in primitive roots. Nevertheless, alike in their
pottery and carvings, and in their picture-writing, they show a
degree of artistic capacity of which few traces are found in
Europe’s Neolithic age.
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Ojibway, <span class='it'>oozhebegawin</span> is used indiscriminately for
“writing, drawing, painting,” <span class='it'>wazhebeegad</span>, for “a man who
writes, draws.” In combination with <span class='it'>muh-ze-ne</span>, “figure, form,”
such words are in use as <span class='it'>muhzenebeégawin</span>, “a painting, drawing”;
<span class='it'>muhzenebeégawenene</span> (M.), <span class='it'>muhzenebeégawequa</span> (F.), “a
painter, an artist”; <span class='it'>muhzenebeégun</span>, “a picture.” “To carve,” or
“engrave on a rock,” is <span class='it'>muhzeneko</span>; <span class='it'>muhzenekojegun</span>, “a
sculptor’s chisel”; <span class='it'>muhzenekoda</span>, “it is carved,” etc. Again
with <span class='it'>wahbegun</span>, “clay,” such holophrasms are obtained as
<span class='it'>wahbegunoonahgunekawenene</span>, “a man who makes earthen
vessels, a potter,” <span class='it'>wahbeguhega</span>, “a worker in clay,” lit. “I
work with clay.”<a id='r110'/><a href='#f110' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[110]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>In previous remarks on the main subject of this paper,
the development of the artistic faculty has been noted as,
in many cases, an exceptional manifestation of intellectual
activity, alike in ancient and modern barbarous races. The
striking contrast between the richly fluent forms of the
language, and the infantile condition of this people in relation
to so much else, including metallurgy, and the application
of the arts generally to the practical requirements of life,
furnishes a no less interesting illustration of intellectual
development fostered by special influences in another direction.
The habitual practice of oratory made the Iroquois acute
reasoners; and their language abounds in abstract terms to a
degree altogether surprising in an uncivilised race. The purposes
of the rhetorician also encouraged the tropical use of
literal terms. It is not, therefore, difficult to understand how
the primary sense of the verb “to track” or “trace out” should
ultimately yield the meaning of “drawing” or “sketching,” and
so finally of “painting.” On the other hand, it abundantly
coincides with the instinctive use of the imitative faculty as
a means of conveying definite ideas to others, that in the
Iroquois, as in other languages, the same terms are used to
express the idea of making a mark, drawing, or writing. The
primitive hieroglyphics, from whence our phonetic alphabets
have come, were first literal drawings, and then their abbreviations
employed to express associated ideas. An ideographic
purpose appears to underlie the earliest efforts of imitative
art.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> has already been noted in treating of pre-Aryan American
men that throughout the northern continent, from the Arctic
circle to the Mexican Gulf, no trace has been recovered of the
previous existence of anything that properly admits of the
term “native civilisation.” The rude arts of Europe’s Stone
age belong to a period lying far behind its remotest traditions;
unless we appeal to the mythic allusions of Hesiod, or to such
poetic imaginings as the <span class='it'>Prometheus</span> of Æschylus. But all
available evidence serves to show that the condition of the native
tribes throughout the northern continent has never advanced
beyond the stage which finds its aptest illustration in the arts
of their Stone period, including the rudimentary efforts at
turning to account their ample resources of native copper
without the use of fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this uniformity in the condition of the aborigines, and
the consequent resemblance in their arts, habits, and mode of
life, has been the fruitful source of misleading assumptions.
Everywhere the European explorer met only rude hunting and
warring tribes, exhibiting such slight variations in all that
first attracts the eye of the most observant traveller, that an
exaggerated idea of their ethnical uniformity was the natural
result. In the systematisings of the ethnologist, the American
type was classed apart as at once uniform and distinctive;
and, strange as it may now seem, this idea found nowhere
such ready favour as among those who had the fullest access
to the evidence by which its truth could be tested. It was
the most comprehensive induction of the author of <span class='it'>Crania
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
Americana</span>, as the fruit of his conscientious researches in
American craniology. The authors of <span class='it'>Indigenous Races of the
Earth</span> and <span class='it'>Types of Mankind</span>, no less unhesitatingly affirmed
that “identical characters pervade all the American races,
ancient and modern, over the whole continent.”<a id='r111'/><a href='#f111' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[111]</span></sup></a> In this they
were sustained by the high authority of Agassiz, who, after
discussing in his <span class='it'>Provinces of the Animal World, and their
relation to Types of Man</span>, the fauna peculiar to the American
continent, and pointing out the much greater uniformity of its
natural productions, when its twin continents are compared
with those of the eastern hemisphere, thus summed up the
result of his investigations: “With these facts before us, we
may expect that there should be no great diversity among the
tribes of man inhabiting this continent; and indeed the most
extensive investigation of their peculiarities has led Dr. Morton
to consider them as constituting but a single race, from the
confines of the Esquimaux down to the southernmost extremity
of the continent. But, at the same time, it should be remembered
that, in accordance with the zoological character of
the whole realm, this race is divided into an infinite number
of small tribes, presenting more or less difference one from
another.” It was natural and reasonable that the men of the
sixteenth century should believe in Calibans, or Ewaipanoma,
“the Anthropophagi, and men whose heads do grow beneath
their shoulders.” America was to them, in the most literal
sense, another world; and it was easier for them to think of
it as peopled with such monstrosities than with human beings
like ourselves. But it is curious to note in this nineteenth
century the lingering traces of the old sentiment; and to see
men of science still finding it difficult to emancipate themselves
from the idea that this continent is so essentially another
world, that it is inconceivable to them that the races by which
it is peopled should bear any affinity to themselves or to others
of the Old World. American ethnologists long clung to the
idea of an essentially distinct indigenous race; and Dr. Nott,
Dr. Meigs, and other investigators welcomed every confirmation
of the view of Dr. Morton as to the occupation of the
whole American continent by one peculiar type from which
alone the Eskimo were to be excepted, as an immigrant
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>
element, possibly—according to the ingenious speculations of
one distinguished student of science,—of remotest European
antiquity. Professor Huxley in an address to the Ethnological
Society in 1869, suggests hypothetically, that the old Mexican
and South American races represent the true American stock;
and that the Red Indians of North America may be the product
of an intermixture of the indigenous native race with the
Eskimo. It is noticeable, at any rate, that nearly all writers,
however widely differing on other points, follow Humboldt in
classing the Eskimo apart as a distinct type. He remarks in
his preface to his <span class='it'>American Researches</span>, that, “except those
which border the polar circle, the nations of America form a
single race characterised by the formation of the skull, the
colour of the skin, the extreme thinness of the beard, and the
straight glossy hair.” Some of the characteristics thus noted
are undoubtedly widely prevalent; but the head-form, or
“formation of the skull,” is the most important; and a careful
comparison of the skulls of different tribes has long since
modified the opinion, expressed by the great traveller and
reasserted by distinguished American ethnologists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reality, were the typical feature most insisted on as
universal as it was assumed to be, it would furnish the
strongest argument for classifying the predominant Asiatic and
American types as one. All the points appealed to suggest
affinity to the Asiatic Mongol. But so far from the Eskimo
standing apart as a markedly exceptional type, if due allowance
be made for the prolonged influence of an Arctic climate,
the Huron-Iroquois approximate to them in some very notable
ethnical features. The dolichocephalic head-form, especially,
is common to them, and to the Algonkin and other Northern
Indians. Of those Dr. Latham remarks: “The Iroquois and
Algonkins exhibit in the most typical form the characteristics
of the North American Indians as exhibited in the earliest
descriptions, and are the two families upon which the current
notions respecting the physiognomy, habits, and moral and
intellectual powers of the so-called Red Race are chiefly
founded.” Of the former, Mr. Parkman, who has studied
their later history with the minutest care, says: “In this
remarkable family of tribes occur the fullest developments of
Indian character, and the most conspicuous examples of Indian
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
intelligence. If the higher traits popularly ascribed to the
race are not to be found here, they are to be found nowhere.”<a id='r112'/><a href='#f112' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[112]</span></sup></a>
To this typical American race, accordingly, and to some of its
peculiarly distinctive usages, special attention is here directed.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The Iroquois were an important branch of the great stock
which included also the Hurons, or Wyandots, the native
historical race of Canada. But divided as the two were
throughout the whole period of French Canadian history by
the bitterest antagonism, it is convenient to speak of them
under the term of Huron-Iroquois. In reviewing the history
of this indigenous stock, with the suggestions prompted by
their peculiar characteristics, it is desirable not only to note
the physical geography of the country which they occupied,
as a region of forest and lakes, but, still more, to keep in view
this fact as a predominant characteristic of the continent, and
as one important factor in the evolution of whatever may seem
to be peculiar in the forest tribes of North America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The effects resulting from the physical features of a country
on the development and intermingling of its races can nowhere
be wisely overlooked. Even within the limits of the British
Islands the influences of mountain and lowlands: of the fertile
stretches of Kent and the valley of the Thames, the fens of
Lincolnshire, the moorlands of Northumbria, and the Welsh
and Scottish Highlands, have largely contributed to the perpetuation,
if not in some degree to the development, of ethnical
distinctions and the diversities in language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this respect Britain is an epitome of Europe, with its
great mountain ranges and detached peninsulas, by means of
which races have been isolated within well-defined areas, and
their languages and other distinctive peculiarities preserved.
Russia alone, of all European countries, presents analogies to
Northern Asia as a region favourable to nomadic life; and in
so far as its history differs from that of the continent at large,
it accords with such physical conditions. Throughout the
whole historic period, as doubtless in prehistoric times, the
great chain of mountains reaching from the western spur of
the Pyrenees to the Balkans has influenced European progress;
while the chief navigable river, the Danube, traversing the
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>
continent through one uniform temperate zone, has tended
still further to the perpetuation of certain distinctive ethnical
characteristics in Central Europe. In all its most important
geographical features, the northern continent of America
presents a striking contrast to this. An isosceles triangle
with its base within the Arctic circle, it tapers to a narrow
isthmus towards the equator. Its great mountain chain runs
from north to south, and in near proximity to the Pacific
coast; and its chief navigable river, rising within the Canadian
Dominion, and receiving as its tributaries rivers draining vast
regions on either hand, traverses twenty degrees of latitude
before it reaches the Gulf of Mexico. A lower range of
highlands towards the Atlantic seaboard forms the eastern
boundary of the great interior plain. But the Alleghanies or
Appalachian system of mountains, though they may be said
to extend from the St. Lawrence to the Mexican Gulf, rise
only at a few points, as in the White Mountains of New
Hampshire, to any great elevation. They form rather a long
plateau, intersected by wide valleys, diversifying the landscape,
without constituting strongly defined barriers or lines of demarcation.
As a whole, the continent of North America,
eastward from the Rocky Mountains, may be described as a
level area, so slightly modified by any elevated regions
throughout its whole extent, from the Arctic circle to the
Gulf of Mexico, as to present no other impediment except
its forests to the wanderings of nomadic tribes. It is interlaced
with rivers, and diversified everywhere with lakes, alike
available for navigation and for fishing; and, until the intrusion
of European immigrants, its forests and prairies abounded
with game far in excess of the wants of its population. Everything
thus tended to perpetuate the condition of nomadic hunter
tribes. This stage of native American history inevitably drew
to a close under the influence of European institutions and
civilisation; but it is interesting to note, that the same absence
of any well-defined geographical limitations of area, which
tended to perpetuate the nomadic habits of the savage, has
aided in consolidating the great confederacy of the United
States, and maintaining an ethnical and political conformity
throughout the northern continent in striking contrast to the
diversities in race and political institutions in Europe.
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>History and native traditions alike confirm the idea that
the valley of the St. Lawrence was the habitat of the Huron-Iroquois
stock as far back as evidence can be appealed to.
The Huron traditions tell of a time when the Province of
Quebec was the home of the race eastward to the sea; while
those of three at least of the members of the Iroquois confederacy
in legendary fashion claimed their birth from the soil
south of the great river. When the French explorers, under
the leadership of Jacques Cartier, first entered the St. Lawrence,
in 1535, they found at Stadaconé and Hochelaga—the old
native sites now occupied by the cities of Quebec and Montreal,—a
population apparently of the Huron-Iroquois stock; and,
in so far as reliance may be placed on their traditions, Canada
was then populous throughout the whole valley of the St.
Lawrence with industrious native tribes, the representatives of
a race that had occupied the same region for unnumbered
centuries. “Some fanciful tales of a supernatural origin from
the heart of a mountain; of a migration to the eastern seaboard;
and of a subsequent return to the country of the lakes
and rivers, where they finally settled, comprise,” says Brownell,<a id='r113'/><a href='#f113' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[113]</span></sup></a>
“most that is noticeable in the native traditions of the Six
Nations prior to the grand confederation.” But the value of
such traditionary transmission of national history among unlettered
tribes has received repeated confirmation; and incidents
in the history of their famous league, perpetuated with circumstantial
minuteness in the traditions of the Iroquois, are
assignable apparently to the fifteenth century. The older
event of the overthrow of the Alligéwi, in the Ohio valley,
of which independent traditional records have been handed
down by the Lenni-Lenape, or Delawares, and by the Iroquois,
is now believed to be correctly assignable to a date nearly
contemporaneous with the assumption of the authority of
Bretwalda of the Heptarchy by Egbert of Wessex,—that
memorable step in the fusion of “nations” not greatly more
important than those of the Iroquois league, until their
divisions in speech and polity were effaced in the unity of
the English people. As to “the fanciful tale of a supernatural
origin from the heart of a mountain,” it is simply a literal
rendering of the old Greek metaphor of the autochthones, or
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
children of the soil, symbolised by the Athenians wearing the
grasshopper in their hair; and is by no means peculiar to the
Iroquois. Mr. Horatio Hale derived from Manderong, an old
Wyandot chief, the story, as narrated to him by the Hurons
of Lorette. They took him, he said, to a mountain, and
showed him the opening in its side from whence the progenitors
of the people emerged, when they “first came out of
the ground.”<a id='r114'/><a href='#f114' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[114]</span></sup></a> The late Huron chief, Tahourenché, or François-Xavier
Picard, communicated to me the same legendary tradition
of the indigenous origin of his people; telling me,
though with a smile, that they came out of the side of a
mountain between Quebec and the great sea. He connected
this with other incidents, all pointing to a traditional belief
that the northern shores of the lower St. Lawrence were the
original home of the race; and he spoke of certain ancient
events in the history of his people as having occurred when
they lived beside the big sea. The earliest authentic reference
to this tradition occurs in the <span class='it'>Relations</span> for 1636, where
Brebeuf, after a brief allusion to certain of their magical songs
and dances, says: “The origin of all such mysteries is assigned
by them to a being of superhuman stature, who was wounded
in the forehead by one of their nation, at the time when they
lived near the sea.” The references to a migration from the
seaboard obviously point to one of those incidents in the life
of the nation which marked for them an epoch like the Hegira
of the Arabs. When Champlain followed Cartier nearly
seventy years later he found only a few Algonkins in their
birch-bark wigwams, where the palisaded towns of the Huron-Iroquois
had stood. But no Algonkin legend claims this as
their early home. The invariable tradition of the Ojibways
points to the Lake Superior region and the country stretching
towards Hudson Bay as the ancestral home of the Algonkin
tribes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such information as can thus be gleaned from a variety of
independent sources, as from the somewhat confused yet trustworthy
narrative of David Cusick, the Tuscarora historian, and
from Peter Dooyentate, the Wyandot historian, all leads to the
same conclusion. From remote and altogether pre-Columbian
centuries, the Hurons and other allied tribes—the occupants
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries of various detached
portions of the country north of the St. Lawrence and eastward
of the Georgian Bay,—appear to have been in possession of
the whole region to which their oldest traditions pointed as the
cradle of the race; while nations of the Algonkin stock lay
beyond them to the north-west. The great river and the
lakes from whence it flows into the lower valley formed a
well-defined southern boundary for affiliated tribes; but the
first Dutch and English explorers of the Hudson, and of the
tract of country which now constitutes the western part of the
State of New York, found the river-valleys and lake shores in
occupation of the Iroquois confederacy, then consisting of
Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas and Senecas. These
constituted the five nations of the famous Iroquois league.
But the Hurons of Canada, with whom they were latterly at
deadly feud, appear to have been the oldest representatives of
the common race, and were still in occupation of their ancestral
home when Cartier first explored the St. Lawrence. The same
race had spread far to the south; and its representatives, in
detached groups, long continued to perpetuate its influence.
These included the Conestogas or Andastes, the Andastogues,
the Carantouans, the Cherohakahs or Nottoways, the Tuscaroras,
and others, under various names. It is not always easy
to recognise the same tribe under its widely dissimilar designations.
The Susquehannocks of the English and the Minquas
of the Dutch, appear to be the Andastes under other designations,
and Champlain’s Carantouans may have been the Eries.
Under those and other names the Huron-Iroquois stock
extended to the country of the Tuscaroras in North Carolina.
Still farther south Gallatin surmised, from linguistic evidence,
a connection between the Cherokees and the Iroquois.<a id='r115'/><a href='#f115' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[115]</span></sup></a> This
fact Mr. Hale has placed beyond doubt; and having detected
in the language of the former a grammatical structure mainly
Huron-Iroquois, while the vocabulary is to a great extent
foreign, he is inclined to think that we thus recover traces of
a people, far south in Alabama and Georgia, the descendants
of refugees of the conquered Alligéwi, adopted into one of the
nations of their Iroquois conquerors.<a id='r116'/><a href='#f116' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[116]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>From one after another of the outlying southern offshoots
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>
of the common stock, additions were made from time to time,
to restore the numbers of the decimated Iroquois. Westward
of the confederacy was the country of the Eries, an offshoot of
the Seneca nation, occupying the southern shore of the great
lake which perpetuates their name. Immediately to the north
of the Eries, within the Canadian frontier, the Attiwendaronks,
or Neuters, occupied the peninsula of Niagara, while the Tiontates
or Petuns, and other tribes of the same stock, were settled
in the fertile region between Lakes Erie and Huron. In 1714,
the Tuscaroras, when driven by the English out of North
Carolina, were welcomed by their Iroquois kinsmen, and received
into the league which thenceforth bore the name of the
Six Nations. Towards the middle of the same century the
waste of war made them ready to welcome any additions to
their numbers; and the Tuteloes and Nanticokes, both apparently
Algonkin, furnished fresh accessions to the diminished
numbers of the confederacy, but without taking their place as
distinct nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of all the nations of the stock thus widely spread westward
and southward, the Hurons are the native historical race
of Canada, intimately identified with incidents of its early
settlement and of friendly intercourse with <span class='it'>La Nouvelle France</span>.
Their language is now recognised as the oldest form of the
common speech of the Huron-Iroquois, and it is not creditable
to Canadian philologists that its grammar still remains unrepresented
in any accurate printed form. The Literary and
Historical Society of Quebec did, indeed, publish in its <span class='it'>Transactions</span>,
in 1831, the translation of a Latin MS., compiled
with much industry by a missionary who had laboured among
the Hurons of Lorette, and whose anonymous work was found
amongst the papers of the mission. But it is the production
of one ignorant of the science of language, and gives no
adequate idea either of the grammatical structure or of the
variety and richness of the Huron tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The languages or dialects spoken by many native Indian
tribes have undoubtedly perished with the races to which they
pertained; but the numerous Huron-Iroquois dialects still
existing, not only in written form, but as living tongues,
afford valuable materials for ethnical study. The history of
other Indian tribes abundantly accounts for the multiplication
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
of a minute diversity of languages so specially characteristic
of the American continent, with the endless subdivisions of
its indigenous population into petty tribes, kept apart by
internecine feuds. The number of native American languages
is estimated by Vater, in his <span class='it'>Linguarum Totius Orbis Index</span>, at
about five hundred. But the question forthwith arises: What
shall be regarded as constituting a language? For, in the
wanderings of little bands of Indian nomads, and the adoption
of refugees from disbanded tribes, dialects multiply indefinitely.
Nearly six hundred of such are catalogued by Mr.
Bancroft, in his <span class='it'>Native Races of the Pacific States</span>, as spoken
between Alaska and the Isthmus of Panama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until recently the tendency has been to assume an underlying
unity of speech for the whole American languages,
based on the polysynthetic or holophrastic characteristic
ascribed to the whole; just as by an exaggerated estimate of
the prevalence of a predominant head-form, one physical type
was long assumed to characterise the American race from
Hudson Bay to Tierra del Fuego. Perhaps, so far as language
is concerned, the present tendency is towards the opposite
extreme. Major Powell, the chief of the Ethnographical
Bureau at Washington, recognises eighty groups of languages
in North America, between which no affinity is thus far apparent.
Fifty-five of those he believes to be satisfactorily
determined as distinct stocks. On the other hand, Professor
Whitney, after noticing the complexity of the inquiry when
directed to the native American languages, thus proceeds:
“Yet it is the confident opinion of linguistic scholars that a
fundamental unity lies at the base of all these infinitely varying
forms of speech; that they may be, and probably are, all
descended from a single parent language.”<a id='r117'/><a href='#f117' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[117]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Here then is a field for much useful research, with the
promise of valuable results. The subject is rendered more
important owing to the fact that, of nearly all the nations of
the North American continent, their languages are the only
surviving memorials of the race. Already, under the efficient
supervision of the Ethnographic Bureau of the United States,
systematic contributions are being secured for this important
branch of knowledge, so far as their own geographical area is
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>
concerned. A no less important area is embraced in the
Dominion of Canada, and the attention of the Government is
now directed to the necessity for timely action in this matter.
In the North-West, and in British Columbia, languages are
disappearing and races becoming extinct. Mr. Hale has
contributed to the American Philosophical Society’s <span class='it'>Transactions</span>
a valuable monogram on the Tutelo tribe and language,
derived mainly from Nikonha, the last full-blood Tutelo, who
survived till upwards of a hundred years of age. He was
married to a Cayuga woman, and lived among her people on
their Grand river reserve. “My only knowledge of the
Tuteloes,” says Mr. Hale, “had been derived from the few
notices comprised in Gallatin’s <span class='it'>Synopsis of the Indian Tribes</span>,
where they are classed with the nations of the Huron-Iroquois
stock. At the same time the distinguished author, with the
scientific caution which marked all his writings, is careful to
mention that no vocabulary of the language was known.
That which was now obtained showed, beyond question, that
the language was totally distinct from the Huron-Iroquois
tongues, and that it was closely allied to the language of the
Dakota family.”<a id='r118'/><a href='#f118' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[118]</span></sup></a> But for the timely exertion of a philological
student, this interesting link in the history of the
Huron-Iroquois relations with affiliated tribes would have
been lost beyond recall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The history of the Huron-Iroquois race, and especially of
the Six Nation Indians, since the settlement of the main
body for the past century on their reserves on the Grand
river, in the Province of Ontario, curiously illustrates the
pertinacity with which they have cherished the dialectic
varieties of a common tongue. But while the essential
differences of language everywhere constitute one of the most
obvious distinctions of race, it is interesting to note the
recognition by the Indians of affinities of dialects, and even
remote kinship based on such evidence; as in the readmission
of the Tuscaroras to the Iroquois family of nations. According
to Brebeuf, the kinship of the Attiwendaronks of the
Niagara peninsula was recognised by the Hurons in that
designation which classed them as a “people of a language
a little different.”<a id='r119'/><a href='#f119' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[119]</span></sup></a> Peter Jones Kahkewaquonaby, a civilised
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
Ojibway, adopted into the Mohawk nation, in speaking of
the traditions of the Indians as to their own origin, says:
“All the information I have been able to gain in relation
to the question amounts to the following. Many, many
winters ago the Great Spirit, Keche-Manedoo, created the
Indians. Every nation speaking a different language is a
second creation, but all were made by the same Supreme
Being.”<a id='r120'/><a href='#f120' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[120]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the races of the northern continent, none east of
the Rocky Mountains more fitly represent their special
characteristics than the great Huron-Iroquois family. Their
language is remarkable for its compass and elaborate grammatical
structure; and the numerous dialects of the
common mother tongue furnish evidence of migration and
conquest over a wide region eastward of the Mississippi.
To such philological evidence many inquirers are now
turning for a clue to the origin of the races of the New
World, and for the recovery of proofs of their affinity to one
or other of the Old World stocks. Professor Whitney, after
dwelling on the “exaggeratedly agglutinative type” of the
ancient Iberian language, and its isolation among the essentially
dissimilar languages of Aryan Europe, thus proceeds:
“The Basque forms a suitable stepping-stone from which to
enter the peculiar linguistic domain of the New World, since
there is no other dialect of the Old World which so much
resembles in structure the American languages”<a id='r121'/><a href='#f121' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[121]</span></sup></a>; not indeed,
as he adds, that they are all of accordant form; for he
pronounces the grouping of them in a single great family as
“a classification of ignorance.” The possibilities of ancient
communication between the opposite shores of the Atlantic,
and the migration of colonists of the New World from the
Mediterranean Sea, have already been discussed in dealing
with the legend of the Lost Atlantis. Great indeed as is the
interval of time therein implied, it would not suffice to erase
all traces of affinity of languages. But it would be vain to
hope for any historical guidance recoverable from the oldest
of Iroquois legends. If, moreover, Iberian, Hittite, Egyptian,
Phœnician, or other of the world’s gray fathers, transplanted
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
to America the germs of its long indigenous stock, we look in
vain for any traces of their Old World civilisation north of the
Mexican Gulf. Nor is it by any means an established truth
that the arts of Central America or Peru are of any very
great antiquity. Their metallurgy was at a crude, yet suggestive,
stage at which it was not likely to be long arrested.
The same may be said of their hieroglyphic records; though
they certainly present some highly significant analogies to the
Chinese phase of word-writing, calculated, along with other
aspects of resemblance to that stage of partial, yet long-enduring,
civilisation of which China is the Asiatic exemplar,
to modify our estimate of the possible duration of Central
and Southern American civilisation. Nevertheless the assumption
of an antiquity in any degree approximating to that
of Egypt seems wholly irreconcilable with the evidence.
Their architecture was barbaric, though imposing from the
scale on which their great temples and palaces were built.
In Central America especially, the aggregation of numerous
ill-lighted little chambers, like honey-comb cells excavated
out of the huge pile, is strongly suggestive of affinity to
the Casas Grandes, and the Pueblos of the Zuñi; and this is
confirmed by the correspondence traceable between many of
their architectural details and the ornamentation of the
Pueblo pottery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The astronomy and the calendars, both of Mexico and
Peru, with their detailed methods of recording their divisions
of time, are all suggestive of an immature phase of civilisation
in the very stage of its emergence from barbarism,
modified, in some cases, by the recent acquisition of certain
arts. As to the peculiar phase of Mexican art, and whatever
other evidence of progress Mexico supplies, they appear to me
no more than natural products of the first successful intrusion
of the barbarians of the northern continent on the seats of
tropical civilisation. Certain it seems, at least, that if an
earlier civilisation had ever existed in the north, or if the
representatives of any Old World type were present there in
numbers for any length of time, some traces of their lost arts
must long since have come to light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the conservative power of language is indisputable;
and if the kinship now claimed for the polysynthetic languages
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
of both hemispheres be correct, we are on the threshold of
significant disclosures. The Huron-Iroquois tongue, in its
numerous ramifications, as well as some of the native languages
that have outlived the last of the races to which
they belonged, may preserve traces of affinities as yet unrecognised.
But in no respect are the Huron-Iroquois more
correctly adducible as a typical race of American aborigines
than in the absence of all evidence of their ever having
acquired any of the arts upon which civilisation depends.
We look in vain in their vocabularies for terms of science,
or for names adapted to the arts and manufactures on which
social progress depends. But they had developed a gift of
oratory, for which their language amply sufficed, and from which
we may infer the presence in this race of savages of latent
powers, capable of wondrous development. “Their languages
show, in their elaborate mechanism, as well as in their fulness
of expression and grasp of thought, the evidence of the
mental capacity of those who speak them. Scholars who
admire the inflections of the Greek and Sanscrit verb, with
their expressive force and clearness, will not be less impressed
with the ingenious structure of the verb in Iroquois. It
comprises nine tenses, three moods, the active and passive
voices, and at least, twenty of those forms which in the
Semitic grammars are styled conjugations. The very names
of these forms will suffice to give evidence of the care and
minuteness with which the framers of this remarkable language
have endeavoured to express every shade of meaning.
We have the diminutive and augmentative forms, the cis-locative
and trans-locative, the duplicative, reiterative, motional,
causative, progressive, attributive, frequentative, and many
others.”<a id='r122'/><a href='#f122' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[122]</span></sup></a> To speak, indeed, of the Iroquois as, in a consciously
active sense, the framers of all this would be misleading.
But it unquestionably grew up in the deliberations
around the council fire, where the conflicting aims of confederate
tribes were swayed by the eloquence of some commanding
orator, until the fiercest warrior of this forest race learned
to value more the successful wielding of the tongue in the
<span class='it'>Kanonsionni</span>, or figurative Long House of the League, even
than the wielding of the tomahawk in the field. At the
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>
organisation of the confederacy, the Canyengas or Mohawks
were figuratively said to have “built a house,” <span class='it'>rodinonsonnih</span>,
or rather to have “built the long house” in which the council
fire of the Five Nations was kindled. Of this the Senecas,
lying on the extreme west, were styled the “door-keepers,”
and the Onondagas, whose territory was central, were the
custodians. The whole usage is rhetorical and figurative.
Under such influences the language of the Huron-Iroquois
was framed, and it grew rich in emotional and persuasive
forms. It only needed the evolution of a true alphabet out
of the pictorial symbolism on their painted robes, or the
grave-posts of their chiefs, to inaugurate a literature which
should embody the orations of the Iroquois Demosthenes,
and the songs of a native Homer, for whom a vehicle of
thought was already prepared, rich and flexible as poet could
desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far as the physical traits of the American aborigines
furnish any evidence of ethnical affinity they unquestionably
suggest some common line of descent with the Asiatic
Mongol; and this is consistent with the agglutinate characteristics
common to a large class of languages of both
continents. But, on the other hand, the characteristic head-form
of the Huron-Iroquois, as well as that of Algonkin and
other northern tribes, deviates alike from the brachycephalic
type of the southern Indians and from that of the Asiatic
Mongols. Humboldt, who enjoyed rare opportunities for
studying the ethnical characteristics of both continents, but
to whom, nevertheless, the northern races, with their dolichocephalic
type of head were unknown, dwells, in his <span class='it'>American
Researches</span>, on the striking resemblance which the American
race bear to the Asiatic Mongols. Latham classes both under
the common head of Mongolidæ; and Dr. Charles Pickering,
of the American Exploring Expedition, arrived at the same
conclusion as the result of his own independent study of the
races of both continents. Nevertheless, however great may be
the resemblance in many points between the true Red Indian
and the Asiatic Mongol, it falls short of even an approximate
physical identity. The Mongolian of Asia is not indeed to be
spoken of as one unvarying type any more than the American.
But the extent to which the Mongolian head-form and peculiar
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>
physiognomy characterise one widely diffused section of the
population of the eastern continent, gives it special prominence
among the great ethnical divisions of the human race.
Morton assigns 1421 as the cranial capacity of eighteen
Mongol, and only 1234 as that of 164 American skulls
other than Peruvian or Mexican. Dr. Paul Topinard, in
discussing the American type, adds: “If we are to rely on
the method of cubic measurement followed by Morton, the
American skull is one of the least capacious of the whole
human race.”<a id='r123'/><a href='#f123' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[123]</span></sup></a> But Dr. Morton’s results are in some respects
misleading. The mean capacity yielded by the measurements
of 214 American skulls in the Peabody Museum of Archæology,
including a considerable number of females, is 1331;
and with a carefully selected series, excluding exceptionally
large and small crania, the results would be higher. Twenty-six
male California skulls, for example, yield a mean capacity
of 1470. The Huron-Iroquois crania would rank among such
exceptional examples.<a id='r124'/><a href='#f124' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[124]</span></sup></a> The forehead is, indeed, low and
receding, but the general cerebral capacity is good; and
Dr. Morton specially notes its approximation to the European
mean.<a id='r125'/><a href='#f125' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[125]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>But the assumption of uniformity in the ethnical characteristics
of the various races of North and South America
is untenable. All probabilities rather favour the idea of different
ethnical centres, a diversity of origin, and considerable
admixture of races. All evidence, moreover, whether physical
or philological, whatever else it may prove, leaves no room for
doubt as to a greatly prolonged period of isolation of the
native races of the New World. Whether they came from
the Mediterranean, in that old mythic dawn the memory of
which survived in the legend of a submerged Atlantis; or the
history of their primeval migration still lingers among fading
traces of philological affinity with the Basques; or if, with the
still more remote glimpses which affinite Arctic ethnology has
been assumed to supply, we seek to follow the palæolithic race
of Central Europe’s Reindeer period in the long pilgrimage to
Behring Straits, and so to the later home of the American
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
Mongol; this, at least, becomes more and more obvious, that
they brought with them no arts derived from the ancient
civilisations of Egypt or of Asia. So far, at least, as the
northern continent is concerned, no evidence tends to suggest
that the aborigines greatly differed at any earlier period from
the condition in which they were found by Cartier when
he first entered the St. Lawrence. They were absolutely
ignorant of metallurgy; and notwithstanding the abundance
of pure native copper accessible to them, they cannot be said
even to have attained to that rudimentary stage of metallurgic
art which for Europe is spoken of as its “Copper Age.”
Copper was to them no more than a malleable stone, which
they fashioned into axes and knives with their stone hammers.
Their pottery was of the most primitive crudeness, hand-fashioned
by their women without the aid of the potter’s
wheel. The grass or straw-plaiting of their basket-work
might seem to embody the hint of the weaver’s loom; but
the products of the chase furnished them with skins of the
bear and deer, sufficient for all purposes of clothing. They
had advanced in no degree beyond the condition of the
neolithic savage of Europe’s Stone age when, at the close
of the fifteenth century, they were abruptly brought into
contact with its cultured arts. The gifted historian, Mr.
Francis Parkman, who has thrown so fascinating an interest
over the story of their share in the long-protracted struggle
of the French and English colonists of North America, says
of them: “Among all the barbarous nations of the continent
the Iroquois stand paramount. Elements which among other
tribes were crude, confused, and embryotic, were among them
systematised and concreted into an established polity. The
Iroquois was the Indian of Indians. A thorough savage,
yet a finished and developed savage. He is perhaps an
example of the highest elevation which man can reach without
emerging from his primitive condition of the hunter.” Yet
with this high estimate of the race as pre-eminent among Red
Indian nations, he adds: “That the Iroquois, left under their
institutions to work out their destiny undisturbed, would ever
have developed a civilisation of their own, I do not believe.”<a id='r126'/><a href='#f126' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[126]</span></sup></a>
They had not, in truth, taken the first step in such a direction;
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
and, were it not for the evidence which language
supplies, it would be conceivable that they, and the whole
barbarian nations of which they are a type, were Mongol
intruders of a later date than the Northmen of the tenth
century; who, it seems far from improbable, encountered only
the Eskimo of the Labrador coast, or their more southern
congeners, then extending to the south of the St. Lawrence.
The prevalence of a brachycephalic type of head among
southern Indian tribes, while dolichocephalic characteristics
are common to the Eskimo and to the Huron-Iroquois and
other northern nations, lends countenance to the idea of an intermixture
of Red Indian and Eskimo blood. The head-forms,
however, though both long, differ in other respects; and a
divergence is apparent on comparing the bones of the face,
with a corresponding difference in their physiognomy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Latham recognised the Iroquois as one of the most
typical families of the North American race, and Mr. Parkman
styles them “the Indian of the Indians.” The whole Huron-Iroquois
history illustrates their patient, politic diplomacy, their
devotion to hunting and to war. But their policy gave no
comprehensive aim to wars which reduced their numbers, and
threatened their very existence as a race. Throughout the
entire period of any direct knowledge of them by Europeans,
there is constant evidence of feuds between members of the
common stock, due in part, indeed, to their becoming involved
in the rivalries of French and English colonists, but also
traceable to hereditary animosities perpetuated through many
generations. The strongly marked diversities in the dialects of
the Six Nations is itself an evidence of their long separation,
prior to their confederation, in the earlier half of the fifteenth
century. By far the most trustworthy narrative of this famous
league is embodied by Mr. Horatio Hale in <span class='it'>The Iroquois Book
of Rites</span>, a contribution to aboriginal American literature of
singular interest and value. Among the members of this
confederacy the Tuscaroras occupy a peculiar position. They
were reunited to the common stock so recently as 1714, but
their traditions accord with those of the whole Huron-Iroquois
family in pointing to the Lower St. Lawrence as their original
home; and the diversity of the Tuscarora dialect from those of
the older nations of the league furnishes a valuable gauge of
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>
the significance of such differences as evidence of the length
of period during which the various members of the common
stock had been separated. On the other hand, the manner in
which, in the absence of any hereditary feud, the Iroquois
respected the bonds of consanguinity, and welcomed the
fugitive immigrants from North Carolina, throws an interesting
light on the history of the race, and the large extent of country
occupied by it in the time of its greatest prosperity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The earliest home of the whole Huron-Iroquois stock was
within the area of Quebec and Eastern Ontario, and they have
thus a claim on the interest of Canadians as their precursors in
the occupation of the soil; while, in so far as its actual
occupancy by the representatives of the common stock is concerned,
the Hurons were welcomed to a friendly, if fatal,
alliance with the early French colonists; and the Iroquois of
the Six Nations have enjoyed a home, under the protection of
England, on the western Canadian reserves set apart for their
use upwards of a century ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is one notable inconsistency in the traditions of the
Huron-Iroquois which is significant. The fathers of the
common stock dwelt, according to their most cherished
memories, in their northern home on the St. Lawrence, and
beside the great sea. It ranked also among the ancient
traditions of the “Wampum-keepers,” or official annalists, that
there came a time when, from whatever cause, the Caniengas—Ka-nyen-ke-ha-ka,
or Flint people, <span class='it'>i.e.</span> the Mohawks,—the
“eldest brother” of the family, led the way from the northern
shore of the St. Lawrence to their later home in what is now
the State of New York. But the prehistoric character of
this later tradition is shown by the fact that the Oneidas,
Onondagas, and Senecas, all claimed for themselves the character
of autochthones in their later home. The precise spot
where, according to the cherished legend of the Oneidas, they
literally sprang from the soil, is still marked by “the Oneida
Stone,” a large boulder of flesh-coloured syenite, from which the
latter called themselves Oniota-aug, “the people begot from
the stone.” It occupies a commanding site overlooking a fine
expanse of country stretching to the Oneida Lake. But,
according to Mr. Hale, the name of the Oneida nation, in the
council of the league, was <span class='it'>Nihatirontakowa</span>, usually rendered
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>
the “great-tree people,” or literally “those of the great log.”
This designation is connected, most probably as an afterthought,
with a legendary meeting of their people with
Hiawatha.<a id='r127'/><a href='#f127' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[127]</span></sup></a> The beautiful legend of this benefactor of his
people has been embalmed in the Indian epic of Longfellow,
and dealt with as a chapter of genuine history in Mr. Horatio
Hale’s <span class='it'>Iroquois Book of Rites</span>. At a period when the tribes were
being wasted by constant wars within and without, a wise and
beneficent chief arose among the Onondagas. His name is
rendered: “he who seeks the wampum belt.” He had long
viewed with grief the dissensions and misery of his people, and
conceived the idea of a federal union which should ensure
peace. The system which he devised was to be not a loose and
transitory league, such as the Indian tribes were familiar with;
but a permanent organisation, foreshadowing as it were the
federal union of the Anglo-American Colonies. “While each
nation was to retain its own council and its management of
local affairs, the general control was to be lodged in a federal
senate, composed of representatives elected by each nation,
holding office during good behaviour, and acknowledged as
ruling chiefs throughout the confederacy. Still further, and
more remarkably, the confederation was not to be a limited one.
It was to be infinitely expansive. The avowed design of its
proposer was to abolish war altogether. He wished the
federation to extend until all the tribes of men should be
included in it. Such,” says Mr. Hale, “is the positive testimony
of the Iroquois themselves, and their statement is supported by
historical evidence.”<a id='r128'/><a href='#f128' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[128]</span></sup></a> The league survived far on into the
eighteenth century; but the dream of universal peace among
the nations of the New World, if it ever found any realisation,
had vanished in the reawakening of the demon of strife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all the accounts of the Iroquois their league is noted as
distinguishing them from the Algonkins and other ruder tribes
of North America. The story of this league has been reproduced
by successive historians, not without rhetorical exaggerations
borrowed from the institutions of civilised nations, both of
ancient and modern times. The late Hon. L. H. Morgan
says of this tribal union: “Under their federal system the
Iroquois flourished in independence, and capable of self-protection,
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>
long after the New England and Virginia races had
surrendered their jurisdictions, and fallen into the condition of
dependent nations; and they now stand forth upon the canvas
of Indian history, prominent alike for the wisdom of their civil
institutions, their sagacity in the administration of the league,
and their courage in its defence. When their power and
sovereignty finally passed away, it was through the events of
peaceful intercourse, gradually progressing to this result.”<a id='r129'/><a href='#f129' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[129]</span></sup></a>
Schoolcraft in like manner refers to “their advancement in the
economy of living, in arms, in diplomacy, and in civil polity,”
as evidence of a remote date for their confederacy.<a id='r130'/><a href='#f130' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[130]</span></sup></a> But while
thus contrasting the “power and sovereignty” of the Iroquois
with the “dependent nations” to the south, Schoolcraft leaves
it manifest that, whatever may have been the extent of the
ancient confederacy, in the seventeenth century their whole
numbers fell short of 12,000; and in 1677 their warriors or
fighting men were carefully estimated at 2150. The diversity
of dialects of the different members of the league is a source of
curious interest to the philologist; but the fact that, among a
people numerically so small, local dialects were thus perpetuated,
is a proof of the very partial influence of the league as a
bond of union. It serves to illustrate the general defect of
native American polity. “Nothing,” says Max Müller, “surprised
the Jesuit missionaries so much as the immense number
of languages spoken by the natives of America. But this, far
from being a proof of a high state of civilisation, rather showed
that the various races of America had never submitted for any
length of time to a powerful political concentration.<a id='r131'/><a href='#f131' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[131]</span></sup></a> The
Iroquois were undoubtedly pre-eminent in the highest virtues of
the savage; and could they have been isolated in the critical
transitional stage, like the ancient Egyptians in their Nile
valley, the Greeks in their Hellenic peninsula, or the Anglo-Saxons
in their insular stronghold—</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. set in the silver sea</p>
<p class='line0'>Which serves it in the office of a wall</p>
<p class='line0'>Or as a moat defensive—</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>until they learned to unite with their courage and persistency in
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>
war some of the elements of progress in civilisation ascribed to
them, they might have proved the regenerators of the continent,
and reserved it for permanent occupation by races of native
origin. “Wherever they went,” says Schoolcraft, “they carried
proofs of their energy, courage, and enterprise. At one period
we hear the sound of their war-cry along the Straits of the St.
Mary’s, and at the foot of Lake Superior; at another, under the
walls of Quebec, where they finally defeated the Hurons under
the eyes of the French.”<a id='r132'/><a href='#f132' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[132]</span></sup></a> And after glancing at the long
history of their triumphs, he adds: “Nations trembled when
they heard the name of the Konoshioni.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In older centuries, while the Huron-Iroquois still constituted
one united people in their ancestral home to the north
of the St. Lawrence, they must have been liable to contact
with the Eskimo, both on the north and the east; and greatly
as the two races differ, the dolichocephalic type of head common
to both is not only suggestive of possible intermixture,
but also of encroachments on the Eskimo in early centuries
by this aggressive race. In the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, as probably at a much earlier date, when the Iroquois
had parted from the Hurons, they became unquestionably
<span class='it'>the</span> aggressive race of the northern continent; and were
an object of dread to widely severed nations. Their earliest
foes were probably the Algonkins, whose original home appears
to have been between Lake Superior and Hudson Bay.
Nevertheless, there was a time, according to the traditions
of both, apparently in some old pre-Columbian century,
when Iroquois and Algonkins combined their forces against
the long-extinct stock whose name survives in that of the
Alleghany Mountains and river. But if so, their numbers
must have then vastly exceeded that of their whole combined
nations at any period subsequent to their first intercourse with
Europeans. For if the growing opinion is correct that the
Alligéwi were the so-called “Mound-Builders” of the Mississippi
and Ohio valleys, they must have been a numerous
people, occupying a territory of great extent, and carrying on
agriculture on a large scale. So far as metallurgy—that
crucial test of civilisation,—is concerned, they had not advanced
beyond the stage of Iroquois progress. Their pottery and
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>
ingenious carvings in stone have already been noted, along
with their singular geometrical earthworks which still puzzle
the American archæologist, from the evidence they show of
skill in a people still practically in their Stone period. The
only conceivable solution of the mystery, as already suggested,
seems to me the assumption of some “Druidic” or Brahminical
caste, distinct from the native Alligéwi stock, who ruled in
those great northern river-valleys, as in Peru; and, like the
mythic Quetzalcoatl of the Aztecs, taught them agriculture,
and directed the construction of the marvellous works to which
they owe their later distinctive name. But for some unknown
reason they provoked the united fury of Iroquois and Algonkins;
and after long-protracted strife were driven out, if not
wholly exterminated. A curious phase of incipient native
civilisation thus perished; and, notwithstanding all the
romance attached to the league of the Iroquois, it is impossible
to credit them at any stage of their own history with
the achievement of such a progress in agriculture or primitive
arts as we must ascribe to this ancient people of the Ohio
valley. To the triumph of the Iroquois in this long-protracted
warfare may have been due the haughty spirit which
thenceforth demanded a recognition of their supremacy from
all surrounding nations. Their partial historians ascribe to
them a spirit of magnanimity in the use of their power, and
a mediatorial interposition among the weaker nations that
acknowledged their supremacy. They appear, indeed, to have
again entered into alliance with an Algonkin nation. Their
annalists have transmitted the memory of a treaty effected with
the Ojibways, when the latter dwelt on the shores of Lake
Superior; and the meeting-place of the two powerful races
was at the great fishing-ground of the Sault Ste. Marie rapids,
within reach of the copper-bearing rocks of the Keweenaw
peninsula. The league then established is believed to have
been faithfully maintained on both sides for upwards of two
hundred years. But if so, it had been displaced by bitter
feud in the interval between the visits of Cartier and Champlain
to the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The historical significance given to the legend of Hiawatha
by the coherent narrative so ingeniously deduced by Mr.
Horatio Hales from <span class='it'>The Iroquois Book of Rites</span>, points to a
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>
long-past era of beneficent rule and social progress among the
Huron-Iroquois. But the era is pre-Columbian, if not mythic.
The pipe of peace had been long extinguished, and the buried
tomahawk recovered, when the early French explorers were
brought into contact with the Iroquois and Hurons. The
history of their deeds, as recorded by the Jesuit Fathers from
personal observation, is replete with the relentless ferocity of
the savage. War was their pastime; and they were ever
ready to welcome the call to arms. La Salle came in contact
with them on the discovery of the Illinois; and Captain John
Smith, the founder of Virginia, encountered their canoes on
the Chesapeake Bay bearing a band of Iroquois warriors to the
territories of the Powhattan confederacy. They were then, as
ever, the same fierce marauders, intolerant of equality with
any neighbouring tribe. The Susquehannocks experienced at
their hands the same fate as the Alligéwi. The Lenapes,
Shawnees, Nanticokes, Unamis, Delawares, Munsees, and Manhattans,
were successively reduced to the condition of dependent
tribes. Even the Canarse Indians of Long Island were
not safe from their vengeance; and their power seems to have
been dreaded throughout the whole region from the Atlantic
to the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It thus appears probable that in remote centuries, before
the discovery of America by European voyagers, the region
extending westward from the Labrador coast to Lake Ontario,
if not, indeed, to Lake Huron, had been in occupation by those
who claimed to be autochthones, and who were known and
feared far beyond their own frontiers. But though thus maintaining
a haughty predominancy; so far as their arts afford
any evidence, they were in their infancy. The country occupied
by them, except in so far as it was overgrown with the
forest, was well adapted for agriculture; and the Iroquois and
Hurons alike compared favourably with the Algonkins in their
agricultural industry. A confirmatory evidence of exceptional
superiority among this remarkable race is that their women
were held in unwonted respect. They had their own representatives
in the council of the tribe; and exercised considerable
influence in the choice of a chief. But on them devolved
all domestic labour, including the cultivation of their fields.
This work was entirely carried on by the women, while the
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>
share of the men in the joint provision of food was the product
of the chase. The beautiful region was still so largely
under forest that it must have afforded abundant resources for
the hunter; but it furnished no facilities for the inauguration
of a copper or bronze age, such as the shores of Lake Superior
in vain offered to its Algonkin nomads. Of metallic ores they
had no knowledge; and while they doubtless prized the copper
brought occasionally from Lake Superior, copper implements
are rare in the region which they occupied. Their old alliance
with the Algonkins of the great copper region had long come
to an end; and when brought under the notice of the French
and English colonists, the Algonkins had joined with the
Hurons as the implacable foes of the Iroquois confederacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the ancient warfare in which Algonkins and Huron-Iroquois
are found united against the nation of the great river
valleys, we see evidences of a conflict between widely distinct
stocks of northern and southern origin. It is an antagonism
between well-defined dolichocephalic and brachycephalic races.
In the dolichocephalic Iroquois or Huron, we have the highest
type of the forest savage; maintaining as his own the territory
of his fathers, and building palisaded towns for the secure
shelter of his people. The brachycephalic Mound-Builder, on
the other hand, may still survive in one or other of the members
of the semi-civilised village communities of New Mexico
or Arizona. But if the interpretation of native traditions have
any value, they carry us back to pre-Columbian centuries, and
tell of long-protracted strife, until what may at first have been
no more than the aggressions of wild northern races, tempted
by the resources of an industrious agricultural community,
became a war of extermination. The elaborately constructed
forts of the Mound-Builders, no less abundant throughout the
Ohio valley than their curious geometrical earthworks, prove
the dangers to which they were exposed, no less than the skill
and determination with which the aggressors were withstood,
it may be through successive generations, before their final
overthrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The palisaded Indian town of Hochelaga, one of the chief
urban centres of the Huron-Iroquois tribes in the older home
of the race, and a sample of the later Huron defences on the
Georgian Bay, stood, in the sixteenth century, at the foot of
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>
Mount Royal, whence the city of Montreal takes its name;
and some of the typical skulls of its old occupants, as well as
flint implements and pottery from its site, are now preserved
in the Museum of M’Gill University. The latter relics reveal
no more than had long been familiar in the remains which
abound within the area of the Iroquois confederacy, and elsewhere
throughout the eastern states of North America. Their
earthenware vessels were decorated with herring-bone and
other incised patterns; and their tobacco pipes and the handles
of their clay bowls were, at times, rudely modelled into human
and animal forms. Their implements of flint and stone were
equally rude. They had inherited little more than the most
infantile savage arts; and when those were at length superseded,
in some degree, by implements and weapons of European
manufacture, they prized the more effective weapons, but
manifested no desire for mastering the arts to which they were
due. To all appearance, through unnumbered centuries, the
tide of human life has ebbed and flowed in the valley of the
St. Lawrence as unprogressively as on the great steppes of
Asia. Such footprints as the wanderers have left on the
sands of time tell only of the unchanging recurrence of generations
of men as years and centuries came and passed away.
Illustrations of native art are now very familiar to us. The
ancient flint pits have been explored; and the flint cores and
rough-hewn nodules recovered. The implements of war and
the chase were the work of the Indian brave. His spears and
arrow heads, his knives, chisels, celts, and hammers, in flint and
stone, abound. Fish-hooks, lances or spears, awls, bodkins,
and other implements of bone and deer’s horn, are little less
common. The highest efforts of artistic skill were expended
on the carving of his stone pipe, and fashioning the pipe-stem.
The pottery, the work of female hands, is usually in the
simplest stage of coarse, handmade, fictile ware. The patterns,
incised on the soft clay, are the conventional reproductions of
the grass or straw-plaiting; or, at times, the actual impressions
of the cordage or wicker-work by which the larger clay vessels
were held in shape, to be dried in the sun before they were
imperfectly burned in the primitive kiln. But the potter also
indulged her fancy at times in modelling artistic devices of
men and animals, as the handles of the smaller ware, or the
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>
forms in which the clay tobacco pipe was wrought. Nevertheless
the northern continent lingered to the last in its
primitive stage of neolithic art; and its most northern were
its rudest tribes, until we pass within the Arctic circle and
come in contact with the ingenious handiwork of the Eskimo.
Southward beyond the great lakes, and especially within the
area of the Mound-Builders, a manifest improvement is noticeable.
Alike in their stone carvings and their modelling in
clay, the more artistic design and better finish of industrious
settled communities are apparent. Still further to the south,
the diversified ingenuity of fancy, especially in the pottery, is
suggestive of an influence derived from Mexican and Peruvian
art. The carved work of some western tribes was also of a
higher character. But taking such work at its best, it cannot
compare in skill or practical utility with the industrial arts of
Europe’s Neolithic age. This region has now been visited and
explored by Europeans for four centuries, during a large portion
of which time they have been permanent settlers. Its
soil has been turned up over areas of such wide extent that the
results may be accepted, with little hesitation, as illustrations
of the arts and social life subsequent to the occupation of the
continent by its aboriginal races. But we look in vain for
evidence of an extinct native civilisation. However far back
the presence of man in the New World may be traced, throughout
the northern continent, at least, he seems never to have
attained to any higher stage than what is indicated by such
evidences of settled occupation as were shown in the palisaded
Indian town of Hochelaga; or at most, in the ancient settlements
of the Ohio valley. Everywhere the agriculturist only
disturbs the graves of the savage hunter. The earthworks of
the Mound-Builders, and still more their configuration, are
indeed suggestive of a people in a condition analogous to that
of the ancient populace of Egypt or Assyria, toiling under the
direction of an overruling caste, and working out intellectual
conceptions of which they themselves were incapable. Yet,
even in their case, this inference finds no confirmation from
the contents of their mounds or earthworks. They disclose
only implements of bone, flint, and stone, with some rare
examples of equally rude copper tools, hammered into shape
without the use of fire. Working in the metals appears to
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>
have been confined to the southern continent; or, at least,
never to have found its way northward of the Mexican plateau.
Nothing but the ingeniously sculptured tobacco pipe, or the
better-fashioned pottery, gives the slightest hint of progress
beyond the first infantile stage of the tool-maker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever may have been the source of special skill among
the old agricultural occupants of the Ohio valley, their
Iroquois supplanters borrowed from them no artistic aptitude.
No remains of its primitive occupants give the slightest hint
that the aborigines of Canada, or of the country immediately
to the south of the St. Lawrence, derived any knowledge from
the old race so curiously skilled in the construction of geometrical
earthworks. Any native burial mounds or embankments
are on a small scale, betraying no more than the
simplest operations of a people whose tools were flint hoes,
and horn or wooden picks and shovels. Wherever evidence
is found of true working in metals, as distinct from the cold-hammered
native copper, as in the iron tomahawk, the copper
kettles, and silver crosses, recovered from time to time from
Indian graves, their European origin is indisputable. Small
silver buckles, or brooches, of native workmanship are indeed
common in their graves; for a metallic currency was so
unintelligible to them that this was the use to which they
most frequently turned French or English silver coinage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But notwithstanding the general correspondence in arts,
habits, and conditions of life, among the forest and prairie
tribes of North America, their distinctive classification into
various dolichocephalic and brachycephalic types points to
diversity of origin and a mingling of several races. So far as
the native races of Canada are considered, it has been shown
that they belong to the dolichocephalic type. The Alligéwi,
or Mound-Builders, on the contrary, appear to have been a
strongly marked brachycephalic race; and the bitter antagonism
between the two, which ended in the utter ruin of the latter,
may have been originally due to race distinctions such as have
frequently been the source of implacable strife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The short globular head-form, which, in the famous Scioto-mound
skull, is shown in a strongly marked typical example
with the longitudinal and parietal diameters nearly equal,
appears to have been common among the southern tribes,
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
such as the Osages, Ottoes, Missouries, Shawnees, Cherokees,
Seminoles, Uchees, Savannahs, Catawbas, Yamasees, Creeks,
and many others. This seems to point to such a convergence,
of two distinct ethnical lines of migration from opposite centres,
as is borne out by much other evidence. In noting this aspect
of the question anew, the further significant fact may also be
once more repeated, that the Eskimo cranium, along with
certain specialties of its own, is pre-eminently distinctive as
the northern type.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among what may be accepted as typical Canadian skulls,
those recovered from the old site of Hochelaga, and from the
Huron ossuaries around Lake Simcoe, have a special value.
They represent the native race which, under various names,
extended from the Lower St. Lawrence westward to Lake St.
Clair. The people encountered by Cartier and the first French
explorers of 1535, and those whom Champlain found settled
around the Georgian Bay sixty-eight years later, appear to
have been of the same stock. Such primitive local names, as
Stadaconé and Hochelaga, are not Algonkin, but Huron-Iroquois.
Native traditions, as well as the allusions of the
earliest French writers, confirm this idea of the occupation by
a Huron-Iroquois or Wyandot population of the “region north-eastward
from the mouth of the St. Lawrence, at or somewhere
along the Gulf coast, before they ever met with the French, or
any European adventurers,” as reaffirmed in the narrative of
their own native historian, Peter Dooyentate.<a id='r133'/><a href='#f133' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[133]</span></sup></a> But whatever
confirmation may be found for this native tradition,
it is certain that the European adventurers bore no part in
their expulsion from their ancient home. The aborigines, whom
Jacques Cartier found a prosperous people, safe in the shelter
of their palisaded towns, had all vanished before the return of
the French under Champlain; and they were found by him
in new settlements, which they had formed far to the westward
on Lake Simcoe and the Georgian Bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Questions of considerable interest are involved in the consideration
of this migration of the Hurons; and the circumstances
under which they deserted their earlier home. They
were visited by Champlain in 1615, and subsequently by the
missionary Fathers, who, in 1639, found them occupying
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>
thirty-two palisaded villages, fortified in the same fashion as
those described by the first French explorers at Stadaconé
and Hochelaga. Their numbers are variously estimated.
Brebeuf reckoned them at 30,000; and described them as
living together in towns sometimes of fifty, sixty, or a hundred
dwellings,—that is, of three or four hundred householders,—and
diligently cultivating their fields, from which they derived
food for the whole year. Whatever higher qualities distinguished
the Iroquois from Algonkin or other native races,
were fully shared in by the Hurons; and they are even
spoken of with a natural partiality by their French allies,
like Sagard, as a patrician order of savages, in comparison
with those of the Five Nations. When first visited by
French explorers, after their protracted journey through the
desolate forests between the Ottawa and Lake Huron, their
palisaded towns and cultivated fields must have seemed like
an oasis in the desert. “To the eye of Champlain,” says Mr.
Parkman, “accustomed to the desolation he had left behind,
it seemed a land of beauty and abundance. There was a
broad opening in the forest, fields of maize with pumpkins
ripening in the sun, patches of sun-flowers, from the seeds of
which the Indians made hair-oil, and in the midst the Huron
town of Otouacha. In all essential points it resembled that
which Cartier, eighty years before, had seen at Montreal; the
same triple palisade of crossed and intersecting trunks, and
the same long lodges of bark, each containing many households.
Here, within an area of sixty or seventy miles, was
the seat of one of the most remarkable savage communities of
the continent.”<a id='r134'/><a href='#f134' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[134]</span></sup></a> The Hurons, thus settled in their latter
home, consisted of several “nations,” including their kinsmen
to the south, as far as Lake Erie and the Niagara river. They
had their own tribal divisions, still perpetuated among their
descendants. The Rev. Prosper Vincent Sa∫∫atannen, a native
Huron, and the first of his race admitted to the priesthood,
informs me that the Hurons of Lorette still perpetuate their
ancient classification into four <span class='it'>grandes compagnies</span>, each of
which has its five tribal divisions or clans, by which of old all
intermarriage was regulated. The members of the same clan
regarded themselves as brothers and sisters, and so were precluded
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>
from marriage with one another. The small number
of the whole band at La Jeune Lorette renders the literal
enforcement of this rule impossible; but the children are still
regarded as belonging to the mother’s clan. The five clans
into which each of the four companies is divided are:—1. The
Deer, <span class='it'>Oskanonton</span>; 2. The Bear, <span class='it'>Anniolen</span>; 3. The Wolf,
<span class='it'>Annenarisk∫∫a</span>; 4. The Tortoise, <span class='it'>Andia∫∫ik</span>; 5. The Beaver,
<span class='it'>Tsotai</span>. There were two, if not more dialects spoken by the
old Hurons, or Wyandots; and that of Hochelaga probably
varied from any form of the language now surviving. This
has to be kept in view in estimating the value of the lists of
words furnished by Jacques Cartier of “le langage des pays et
Royaulmes de Hochelaga et Canada, aultrement appellée par
nous la nouvelle France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the condition of the region to the west of the Ottawa
prior to the seventeenth century nothing is known from
direct observation. Before Champlain had an opportunity of
visiting it, the whole region westward to Lake Huron had
been depopulated and reduced to a desert. The fact that the
few natives found by Champlain occupying the once populous
region of the Hochelaga Indians were Algonkins, has been the
chief ground for the assumption that the expulsion of that old
Wyandot stock was due to their hostility. But such an idea
is irreconcilable with the fact that the latter, instead of
retreating southward to their Huron-Iroquois kinsmen, took
refuge among Algonkin tribes. According to the narrative
of their own Wyandot historian, Peter Dooyentate, gathered,
as he tells us, from traditions that lived in the memory of
a few among the older members of his tribe, the island of
Montreal was occupied in the sixteenth century by Wyandots
or Hurons, and Senecas, sojourning peaceably in separate
villages. The tradition is vague which traces the cause of
their hostility to the wrath of a Seneca maiden, who had
been wronged by the object of her affections, and gave her
hand to a young Wyandot warrior on the condition of his
slaying the Seneca chief, to whose influence she ascribed the
desertion of her former lover. Whatever probability may
attach to this romance of the Indian lovers, the tradition
that the Hurons were driven from their ancient homes on
the St. Lawrence by their Seneca kinsmen is consistent with
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>
ascertained facts, as well as with the later history of the
Senecas, who are found playing the same part to the Eries
under a somewhat similar incentive to revenge, and appear to
have taken the lead in the destruction of the Attiwendaronks.
The native tradition is of value in so far as it shows that the
fatal enmity of the Iroquois to the Hurons was not originally
due to the alliance of the latter with the French; but Senecas
and Hurons had alike disappeared before Champlain visited
the scene of Cartier’s earlier exploration. The Attiwendaronks,
who dwelt to the south of the later home of the Hurons, on
the shores of Lakes Ontario and Erie, may have formed
another of the nations of the Wyandot stock expelled from
the valley of the St. Lawrence. Situated as they were in
their later home, midway between the Hurons and Iroquois,
they strove in vain to maintain a friendly neutrality. Charlevoix
assigns the year 1635 as the date of their destruction
by the latter. Certain it is that between that date and the
middle of the century their towns were utterly destroyed;
and such of the survivors as lingered in the vicinity were
incorporated into the nation of the Senecas, who lay nearest
to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eries were another Huron-Iroquois nation who appear
to have persistently held aloof from the league. They were
seemingly a fiercer and more warlike people than the Attiwendaronks;
they fought with poisoned arrows, and were
esteemed or dreaded as warriors. Their numbers must have
been considerable, since they were an object of apprehension
to the nations of the league whose western frontiers marched
with their own. They are affirmed by the native historian,
Cusick, to have sprung from the Senecas; but, if so, their
separation was probably of remote date, as they were both
numerous and powerful. The country which they occupied
was noted among the French <span class='it'>coureurs des bois</span> for its lynx
furs; and they gave accordingly to its people the name of
“La Nation du Chat.” Their ancient home is still indicated
in the name of the great lake beside which they dwelt. But,
for some unknown reason, they refused all alliance with the
Senecas and the league of their Iroquois kin, and perished by
their violence within seven years after the Huron country
was laid waste. “To the Eries, and to the Neuter nation,”
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>
or Attiwendaronks, says Schoolcraft, “according to tradition,
the Iroquois offered the alternative of admission into the
league or extermination; and the strangeness of this proposition
will disappear, when it is remembered that an Indian
nation regards itself as at war with all others not in actual
alliance.”<a id='r135'/><a href='#f135' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[135]</span></sup></a> Peace, he adds, was the ultimate aim of the
founders of the Iroquois oligarchy; and, for lovers of peace
on such terms of supremacy, the <span class='it'>casus belli</span> would not be more
difficult to find than it has proved to be among the most
Christian of kings. In the case of the Eries, as of the elder
Wyandots of Hochelaga, the final rupture is ascribed to a
woman’s implacable wrath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Le Moyne, while on a mission to the Onondagas in
1654, learned that the Iroquois confederacy were excited to
fury against the Eries. A captive Onondaga chief is said to
have been burnt at the stake after he had been offered,
according to Indian custom, to one of the Erie women, to
take the place of her brother who had been murdered while
on a visit to the Senecas. It is a characteristic illustration of
how the feuds of ages were perpetuated. The traditions of
the Iroquois preserved little more than the fact that the Eries
had perished by their fury. But a story told to Mr. Parkman
by a Cayuga Indian, only too aptly illustrates the hideous
ferocity of their assailants. It represented that the night
after the great battle in which the Eries suffered their final
defeat, the forest was lighted up with more than a thousand
fires, at each of which an Erie was being tortured at the
stake.<a id='r136'/><a href='#f136' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[136]</span></sup></a> The number is probably exaggerated. But it is only
thus, as it were in the lurid glare of its torturing fires, that we
catch a glimpse of this old nation as it vanished from the
scene. Of the survivors, the greater number were adopted,
according to Indian fashion, into the Seneca nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the earthworks met with to the south of Lake Erie
show proofs of greater constructive labour than anything found
in Canada. Still more interesting are the primitive hieroglyphics
of an inscription on Cunningham’s Island, ascribed to
the Eries, and which Schoolcraft describes as by far the most
elaborate work of its class hitherto found on the continent.<a id='r137'/><a href='#f137' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[137]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>
But the rock inscription, though highly interesting as an
example of native symbolism and pictographic writing, throws
no light on the history of its carvers; and of their language no
memorial is recoverable, for they had ceased to exist before the
great lake which perpetuates their name was known to the
French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More accurate information has been preserved in reference
to the Hurons, among whom the Jesuit Fathers laboured with
self-denying zeal, from time to time reporting the results
in their <span class='it'>Relations</span> to the Provincial of the Order at Paris.
One of the most characteristic religious ceremonies of the
Hurons was the great “Feast of the Dead,” celebrated apparently
at intervals of twelve years, when the remains of their
dead were gathered from scaffolded biers, or remote graves, and
deposited amid general mourning in the great cemetery of the
tribe. Valuable robes and furs, pottery, copper kettles and
others of their choicest possessions, including the pyrulæ, or
large tropical shells brought from the Gulf of Mexico, with
wampum, prized implements, and personal ornaments, were all
thrown into the great trench, which was then solemnly covered
over. By the exploration of those Huron ossuaries, the sites
of the palisaded villages of the Hurons of the seventeenth
century have been identified in recent years; and there are
now preserved in the Laval University at Quebec upwards of
eighty skulls recovered from cemeteries at St. Ignace, St.
Joachin, Ste. Marie, St. Michael, and other villages, the scenes
of self-denying labour, and in some cases of the cruel torturings,
of the French missionaries by whom they were thus
designated. Other examples of skulls from the same ossuaries,
I may add, are now in the Museums of the University of
Toronto, the London Anthropological Society, and the Jardin
des Plantes at Paris. The skulls recovered from those ossuaries
have a special value from the fact that the last survivors
were driven out of the country by their Iroquois foes in 1649;
and hence the crania recovered from them may be relied upon
as fairly illustrating the physical characteristics of the race
before they had been affected by intercourse with Europeans.
The Huron skull is of a well-defined dolichocephalic type,
with, in many cases, an unusual prominence of the occipital
region; the parietal bones meet more or less at an angle at
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>
the sagittal suture; the forehead is flat and receding; the
superciliary ridges in the male skulls are strongly developed;
the malar bones are broad and flat, and the profile is orthognathic.
Careful measurements of thirty-nine male skulls yield
a mean longitudinal diameter of 7.39 to a parietal diameter of
5.50; and of eighteen female skulls, a longitudinal diameter
of 7.07 to a parietal diameter of 5.22.<a id='r138'/><a href='#f138' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[138]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Who were the people found by Cartier in 1535, seemingly
long-settled and prosperous, occupying the fortified towns of
Stadaconé and Hochelaga, and lower points on the St.
Lawrence? The question is not without a special interest to
Canadians. According to the native Wyandot historian, they
were Wyandots or Hurons, and Senecas. That they were
Huron-Iroquois, at any rate, and not Algonkins, is readily
determined. We owe to Cartier two brief vocabularies of their
language, which, though obscured probably in their original
transcription, and corrupted by false transliterations in their
transference to the press, leave no doubt that the people spoke
a Huron-Iroquois dialect. To which of the divisions it
belonged is not so obvious. The languages, in the various
dialects, differ only slightly in most of the words which Cartier
gives. Sometimes they agree with Huron, and sometimes
with Iroquois equivalents. The name of Hochelaga, “at the
beaver-dam,” is Huron, and the agreement as a whole preponderates
in favour of a Huron rather than an Iroquois dialect.
But there was probably less difference between the two then,
than at the more recent dates of their comparison. In dealing
with this important branch of philological evidence, I have
been indebted to the kindness of my friend, Mr. Horatio Hale,
for a comparative analysis of the vocabulary supplied by
Cartier, embodying the results of long and careful study. He
has familiarised himself with the Huron language by personal
intercourse with members of a little band of civilised Wyandots,
settled on their reserve at Anderdon, in Western Ontario.
The language thus preserved by them, after long separation
from other members of the widely scattered race, probably
presents the nearest approximation to the original forms of the
native tongue, as spoken on the Island of Montreal and the
lower St. Lawrence. In comparing them allowance has to be
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>
made for varieties of dialect among the old occupants of the
lower valley of the St. Lawrence, and also for the changes
wrought on the Huron language in the lapse of three and a
half centuries, not simply by time, but also as the result of
intercourse and intermixture with other peoples. The habit
of recruiting their numbers by the adoption of prisoners and
broken tribes could not fail to exercise some influence on
the common tongue. The <span class='it'>k</span> or hard <span class='it'>g</span> of Cartier is, in the
Wyandot, frequently softened to a <span class='it'>y</span>; and on the other
hand, the <span class='it'>n</span> is strengthened by a <span class='it'>d</span> sound, as in Cartier’s
pregnant term <span class='it'>Canada</span>, the old Hochelaga word for a town,
which has become in the Wyandot <span class='it'>Yandata</span>; and so in other
instances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The revolution which, at the critical period of the advent of
the Trench in the valley of the St. Lawrence, in the interval
of sixty-eight years between the visits of Cartier and Champlain,
displaced the fortified and populous Indian capital of
Hochelaga and left the surrounding regions a desolate wilderness,
is a mysterious event. Had Champlain been curious to
learn the facts of an occurrence then so recent there could
have been little difficulty in recovering the history of the
exodus of the Hochelagans. But it had no interest for the
French adventurers of that day. The well-fortified Wyandot
towns had given place to a few ephemeral birch-bark
wigwams belonging to another race; and the readiest solution
of the mystery has been to ascribe the expulsion of the
Wyandots, or Hurons, from their ancient home in Eastern
Canada, to the Algonkins. This, as already shown, is irreconcilable
with the fact that Champlain found them in friendly
alliance with the latter against their common foe, the Iroquois.
If, however, the Wyandot tradition of the expulsion of the
Hurons from the island of Montreal by the Senecas be
accepted, it is in no degree inconsistent with the circumstances
subsequently reported by Champlain; but rather serves to
account for some of them, if it is assumed that the Senecas
were, in their turn, driven out by the Algonkins, and then
finally withdrew beyond the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there is another kind of evidence bearing on the question
of the affinities of the people first met with by Cartier in
1535, which also has its value here. The descriptions of the
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>
palisaded towns of the Hurons on the Georgian Bay very
accurately reproduce that which Cartier gives of Hochelaga.
Ephemeral as such fortifications necessarily were, the construction
of a rampart formed of a triple row of trunks of trees,
surmounted with galleries, from whence to hurl stones and
other missiles on their assailants, was a formidable undertaking
for builders provided with no better tools than stone
hatchets, and with no other means of transport than their
united labour supplied. But the design had the advantage of
furnishing a self-supporting wall, and so of saving the greater
labour of digging a trench, with such inadequate tools, in soil
penetrated everywhere with the roots of forest trees. It was
the Huron-Iroquois system of military engineering, in which
they contrasted favourably with the Algonkins, among whom
the absence of such evidence of settled habits as those secure
defences supplied, was characteristic of these ruder nomads.
But such urban fortifications no less strikingly contrast with
the elaborate and enduring military earthworks to the south of
the great lakes. The pottery and implements found on the
site of Hochelaga are of the same character as many examples
recovered from the Huron ossuaries. On the other hand the
peculiar rites, of which those ossuaries are the enduring
memorials, appear to have distinguished the western Hurons
from the older settlers on the St. Lawrence. The great Feast
of the Dead, with its recurrent solemnities, when after the
lapse of years the remains of their dead were exhumed, or
removed from their scaffold biers, was the most characteristic
religious ceremonial of the Hurons; and was practised with
still more revolting rites by the kindred Attiwendaronks.
Festering dead bodies were kept in their dwellings, preparatory
to scraping the flesh from their bones; and the decaying
remains of recently buried corpses were exhumed for reinterment
in the great trench, which was prepared with enormous
labour, and furnished with the most lavish expenditure of
prized furs, wampum, and other possessions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all ages and states of society unavailing sorrow has tempted
the survivors to extravagant excesses in the effort to do honour
to the loved dead; and sumptuary laws have been repeatedly
enacted to restrain such demonstrations within reasonable
bounds. <span class='it'>The Book of Rites</span> suffices to suggest that the ancient
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>
funeral rites of the Iroquois were of the same revolting and
wasteful character, until their mythic reformer, Hiawatha,
superseded them with a simpler symbolical funeral service.
“I have spoken of the solemn event which has befallen you,”
are the introductory words to the thirteenth paragraph of “The
Condoling Council,” and it thus proceeds: “Every day you
are losing your great men. They are being borne into the
earth; also the warriors, and also your women, and also your
grandchildren; so that in the midst of blood you are sitting.” It
is therefore enacted, in the twenty-seventh paragraph, evidently
in lieu of older practices: “This shall be done. We will suspend
a pouch upon a pole, and will place in it some mourning
wampum, some short strings, to be taken to the place where
the loss was suffered. The bearer will enter, and will stand
by the hearth, and will speak a few words to comfort those
who will be mourning; and then they will be comforted, and
will conform to the great law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A string of black wampum sent round the settlement is still,
among the Indians of the Six Nations, the notice of the death
of a chief, as a belt of black wampum was a declaration of
war. It seems not improbable that the people of Stadaconé
and Hochelaga had submitted to the wise social and religious
reforms by which the ancient rites of their dead were superseded
by the symbolism of the mourning wampum, and hence
the absence of ossuaries throughout the island of Montreal and
the whole region to the east. But when the fugitive Wyandots
fled into the wilderness, and reared new homes around Lake
Simcoe and in the western peninsula, they may have revived
traditional usages of their fathers, and resumed rites which had
been reluctantly abandoned. Among the civilised Indians of
the Six Nations some memorials of their ancestral rites of the
dead still survive. A visitor to the reserve at the time of the
death of a late highly esteemed chief told me that on the event
being known it was immediately responded to by all within
hearing by the prolonged utterance, in a mournful tone, of the
cry <span class='it'>Kwé</span>, and this, passing from station to station, spread the
news of their loss throughout the reserve. Nearly the same
sound, uttered in a quicker note, <span class='it'>Quaig!</span> is the salutation among
the Hurons of Lorette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The later history of the Hurons and Iroquois is not without
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>
its special interest. One little band, the Hurons of Lorette,
the representatives of the refugees from the massacre of 1648,
has lingered till our own day in too close proximity to the
French <span class='it'>habitants</span> of Quebec to preserve in purity the blood of
the old race. But great as are the alterations which time and
intermixture with the white race have effected, they still
retain many intellectual as well as physical traits of their
original stock after an interval of two hundred and thirty-six
years, during which intimate intercourse, and latterly frequent
intermarriage with those of European blood, have wrought
inevitable change on the race.<a id='r139'/><a href='#f139' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[139]</span></sup></a> Other more vigorous representatives
of the old Huron stock occupy a small reservation
in the Township of Anderdon, in Western Ontario, from whom
the vocabulary was derived which furnished a test of the
language of the Hochelagans in the sixteenth century. But
the Hurons of Lorette have also preserved their native tongue;
and an ample vocabulary<a id='r140'/><a href='#f140' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[140]</span></sup></a> of the older form of their language
survives. A third modification of the ancient tongue no doubt
exists; for the larger remnant of the survivors of the Hurons,
after repeated wanderings, is now settled, far from the native
home of the race, on reserves conceded to them by the American
Government in Kansas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hurons have thus, for the most part, disappeared from
Canada; but it is not without interest to note that the revolution
which, upwards of a century ago, severed the connection
of the old colonies to the south of the St. Lawrence with the
region to the north, restored to Canada its ancient Iroquois.
This race of savage warriors acquired the mastery of a region
equal in extent to Central Europe; and by a system of warfare,
not, after all, more inherently barbarous or recklessly
bloody than that of Europe’s Grand Monarch, reconstructed the
social and political map of the continent east of the Mississippi.
Their influence acquired a novel importance when, in the
seemingly insignificant rivalries of French and English fur-traders,
they practically determined the balance of power
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>
between the two foremost nations of Europe on this continent.
Their indomitable pertinacity proved more than a match alike
for European diplomacy and military skill; and, as they
maintained an uncompromising hostility to the French at a
time when the rival colonists were nearly equally balanced, the
failure of the magnificent schemes of Louis XIV. and his
successors to establish in North America such a supremacy as
Charles V. and Philip II. had held in Mexico and Peru, is
largely traceable to them. It is natural that the Anglo-American
student of history should estimate highly the polity
of savage warriors who thus foiled the schemes of one of the
most powerful monarchies of Europe for the mastery of this
continent. The late Hon. L. H. Morgan thus writes of them:
“They achieved for themselves a more remarkable civil organisation,
and acquired a higher degree of influence, than any
other race of Indian lineage except those of Mexico and Peru.
In the drama of European colonisation they stood, for nearly
two centuries, with an unshaken front against the devastations
of war, the blighting influence of foreign intercourse, and the
still more fatal encroachments of a restless and advancing
border population. Under their federal system the Iroquois
flourished in independence, and capable of self-protection, long
after the New England and Virginia races had surrendered
their jurisdictions, and fallen into the condition of dependent
nations; and they now stand forth upon the canvas of Indian
history, prominent alike for the wisdom of their civil institutions,
their sagacity in the administration of the league, and
their courage in its defence.”<a id='r141'/><a href='#f141' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[141]</span></sup></a> But in this their historian
applies to the Iroquois a European standard, similar to that
by which Prescott unconsciously magnified Mexican barbarism
into a rivalry with the contemporary civilisation of Spain.
The romance attached to the Hodenosauneega, or Kononsionni,
the famous league of the Long House or United Households,
more truly derives its chief interest and value from the fact
that its originators remained to the last savages. It is, at any
rate, important to keep this fact in view, and to interpret the
significance of the league in that light. When the treaty
which initiated it was entered into by the Caniengas and the
Oneidas, they were both in that primitive stage of unsophisticated
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>
barbarism to which the term “Stone Period” has been
applied. In the absence of all knowledge of metallurgy, their
implements and weapons were alike simple and rude. Agriculture,
under such conditions, must have been equally primitive;
and as for their wars, when they were not defensive, they
appear to have had no higher aim than revenge. Gallatin, no
unappreciative witness, says of them: “The history of the Five
Nations is calculated to give a favourable opinion of the
intelligence of the Red Man. But they may be ranked among
the worst of conquerors. They conquered only in order to
destroy, and, it would seem, solely for the purpose of gratifying
their thirst for blood. Towards the south and the west they
made a perfect desert of the whole country within 500 miles
of their seats. A much greater number of those Indians,
who since the commencement of the seventeenth century have
perished by the sword in Canada and the United States, have
been destroyed by that single nation than in all their wars with
the Europeans.”<a id='r142'/><a href='#f142' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[142]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>To characterise the combination effected among such tribes
as one presenting elements of wise civil institutions; or indeed
to introduce such terms as league and federal system, in the
sense in which they have been repeatedly employed, as though
they referred to a confederation akin to those of the ancient
Achæans or Ætolians, is to suggest associations altogether misleading.
Though an interesting phase of American savage life,
to which its long duration gives a marked significance, the
Iroquois league was by no means unique; though it was the
oldest, and may have been the model on which others were
framed. The Creek confederacy embraced numerous tribes
between the Mobile, Alabama, and Savannah rivers, and the
Gulf of Mexico. At the head of it were the Muskhogees, a
numerous and powerful, but wholly savage race of hunters.
Like the Oneidas, Onandagas, and the still older Wyandots,
they and the Choctaws claimed to be autochthones. The
Muskhogees appealed to a tradition of their ancestors that they
issued from a cave near the Alabama river; while the Choctaws
pointed to the frontier region between them and the Chickasaws,
where, as they affirmed, they suddenly emerged from a hole in
the earth, a numerous and mighty people. The system of
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>
government amongst the members of this southern confederacy
seems to have borne considerable resemblance to that of the
Iroquois; if it was not borrowed from it. Every village was
the centre of an independent tribe or nation, with its own
chief; and the restraints imposed on the individual members,
except when co-operating in some special enterprise or religious
ceremonial, appear to have been slight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Hale has shown that the language of the Cherokees
has a grammar mainly Huron-Iroquois, and a vocabulary largely
recruited from some foreign source. From this he infers that
one portion of the conquered Alligéwi, while the conflict still
lasted, may have cast in their lot with the conquering race,
just as the Tlascalans did with the Spaniards in their war
against the Aztecs, and hence the origin of the great Cherokee
nation. The fugitive Alligéwi, he surmises, may have fled
down the Mississippi till they reached the country of the
Choctaws, themselves a mound-building people; and to the
alliance of the two he would thus trace the difference in the
language of the latter from that of their eastern kindred, the
Creeks or Muskhogees.<a id='r143'/><a href='#f143' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[143]</span></sup></a> On the assumption of such a combination
of ethnical elements, the origin of the Creek confederacy
is easily accounted for. It is to this same element of language
that we have to revert for guidance in the interpretation of the
history of this remarkable race. It would be an evasion of the
most essential evidence on which any reliable conclusions must
be based, if the fact were overlooked that the Iroquois never
emerged beyond the primitive stage of the Stone period.
Nevertheless in one element of intellectual development their
progress had been great. Each nation of the Iroquois league
had its chief, to whom pertained the right of kindling the
symbolic council-fire, and of taking the lead in all public
assemblies. When the representative chiefs of the nations
gathered in the Long House around the common council-fire
of the league, it was no less necessary that they should be able
and persuasive speakers than brave warriors. Rhetoric was
cultivated in the council-house of the Iroquois no less earnestly
than in the Athenian ekklesia or the Roman forum. Acute
reasoning and persuasive eloquence demanded all the discriminating
refinements of grammar, and the choice of terms which an
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>
ample vocabulary supplies. The holophrastic element has been
noted as a peculiar characteristic of American languages. The
word-sentences thus constructed not only admitted of, but
encouraged, an elaborate nicety of discrimination; while the
marked tendency of the process, so far as the language itself is
concerned, was to absorb all other parts in the verb. Time,
place, manner, aim, purpose, degree, and all the other modifications
of language are combined polysynthetically with the root.
Nouns are to a large extent verbal forms; and not only nouns
and adjectives, but adverbs and prepositions, are regularly conjugated.
Elaborated polysyllables, flexibly modified by
systematic internal changes, give expression, in one compounded
word-sentence, to every varying phase of intricate reasoning or
emotion; and the complex structure shows the growth of a
language in habitual use for higher purposes than the mere
daily wants of life. The vocabulary in use in some rural districts
in England has been found to include less than three
hundred words; and in provincial dialects, thus restricted, the
refinements of grammatical expression disappear. Among such
rustic communities speech plays a very subordinate part in the
business of life. But upon the deliberations of the Indian
council-house depended the whole action of the confederacy.
Hence, while in all else the Iroquois remained an untutored
savage, his language is a marvellously systematised and beautiful
structure, well adapted to the requirements of intricate
reasoning and persuasive subtlety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Whitney says, in reference to American languages
generally, what may more especially be applied to the Huron-Iroquois:
“There are infinite possibilities of expressiveness in
such a structure; and it would only need that some native American
Greek race should arise, to fill it full of thought and
fancy, and put it to the uses of a noble literature, and it would
be rightly admired as rich and flexible, perhaps beyond anything
else that the world knew.”<a id='r144'/><a href='#f144' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[144]</span></sup></a> Yet, on the other hand, the
Iroquois dispense with the whole labials, never articulate with
their lips, and throw entirely aside from their alphabetical series
of phonetics six of those most constantly in use by us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this direction, then, lies an ethnological problem which
cannot fail to awaken ever-increasing interest. To the native
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>
languages of the New World we must look for a true key to
the solution of some of the most curious and difficult questions
involved in the peopling of the continent. “There lies before
us,” says Professor Whitney, “a vast and complicated problem
in the American races; and it is their language that must do
by far the greatest part of the work in solving it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the languages of the Huron-Iroquois, the Huron appears
to be the oldest, if not the parent stock. When this aggressive
race had spread, as conquerors, far to the south of the St.
Lawrence, the mother nation appears to have held on to the
cradleland of the race, where its representatives were found
still in possession when the first European explorers entered
the St. Lawrence. Colonists, of French or English origin, have
been in more or less intimate intercourse with them ever since,
yet the materials for any satisfactory study of the Huron
language, or of a comparison between it and the various
Iroquois dialects, are still scanty and very inadequate. The
languages of the Five Nations that originally constituted the
members of the Iroquois league, are, in the strictest sense of the
term, dialects. In their council-house on the Grand river, the
chiefs of the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onandagas, Cayugas, and
Senecas, speak each in their own language and need no interpreter.
Nevertheless, the differences are considerable; and a
Seneca would scarcely find the language of a Mohawk intelligible
to him in ordinary conversation. But the separation of
the Tuscaroras from the Iroquois on the Mohawk river had
been of long duration, and their language differs much more
widely from the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mohawk language was adopted at an early date for
communicating with the Indians of the Six Nations. The New
England Company, established in 1649, under favour of the
Lord Protector, Cromwell, “for the propagation of the Gospel
in New England,” was revived on the restoration of Charles II.
under a royal charter; and with the eminent philosopher,
Robert Boyle, as its first governor, vigorous steps were taken
for the religious instruction of the Indians. The correspondence
of Eliot, “the Apostle of the Indians,” with the first governor
of the Company, is marked by their anxiety for the completion
of the Massachusetts Bible, which, along with other books, he
had translated for the benefit of the Indians of New England.
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>
The silver Communion Service, still preserved at the reserve on
the Grand river, presented to the ancestors of the Mohawk
nation by Queen Anne, is an interesting memorial of the early
efforts for their Christianisation. It bears the inscription:
“A. R., 1711. <span class='sc'>The Gift of Her Majesty, by the Grace of
God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, and of her
Plantations in North America, Queen: to her Indian
Chappel of the Mohawks.</span>” The date has a special interest in
evidence of the transforming influences already at work; for it
was not till three years later that the Tuscaroras were received
into the confederation, and the Iroquois became known by their
later appellation as the Six Nation Indians. In accordance
with the efforts indicated by the royal gift, repeated steps were
taken for translating the Scriptures and the Prayer-Book into
their language. In a letter of the Rev. Dr. Stuart, missionary
to the Six Nations, dated 1771, he describes his introduction
to Captain Brant at the Mohawk village of Canajoharie, and
the aid received from him in revising the Indian Prayer-Book,
and in translating the Gospel of St. Mark and the Acts of the
Apostles into the Mohawk language. The breaking out of the
revolutionary war arrested the printing of these translations.
The manuscripts were brought to Canada in 1781, and placed
in the hands of Colonel Clause, the Deputy Superintendent of
Indian Affairs. This gentleman subsequently carried them to
England, where they were at length printed. A more recent
edition of the Mohawk Prayer-Book, prepared under the
direction of the Rev. Abraham Nelles, a missionary of the New
England Company, with the aid of a native catechist, issued
from the Canadian press in 1842. The Indian text is accompanied
with its English equivalent on the opposite page, and
this <span class='it'>Kaghyadouhsera ne Yoedereanayeadagwha</span>, or Book of
Common Prayer, is still in use in the religious services of
the Six Nation Indians at their settlement on the Grand
river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some characteristics of the language, such as the absence of
labials, constitute not only a distinctive difference from the
old Huron speech, but afford proof of the latter being the older
form. “It is a fact,” says Professor Max Müller, in referring
to his intercourse with an intelligent native Mohawk, then a
student at Oxford, “that the Mohawks never, either as infants
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>
or as grown-up people, articulate with their lips. They have
no <span class='it'>p</span>, <span class='it'>b</span>, <span class='it'>m</span>, <span class='it'>f</span>, <span class='it'>v</span>, <span class='it'>w</span>—no labials of any kind.”<a id='r145'/><a href='#f145' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[145]</span></sup></a> The statement,
so far as the Mohawk infants are concerned, is open to further
inquiry; but Dr. Oronhyatekha, the Mohawk referred to, who
pursued his studies for a time in the University of Toronto, and
to whom I have been largely indebted in this and other
researches in Indian philology, not only rejects the six letters
already named, but also <span class='it'>c</span>, <span class='it'>g</span>, <span class='it'>l</span>, <span class='it'>z</span>. The alphabet is thus reduced
to seventeen letters. Professor Max Müller notes in passing,
that the name “Mohawk” would seem to prove the use of the
labial. But it is of foreign origin, though possibly derived from
their own term: <span class='it'>oegwehokough</span>, “people.” The name employed
by themselves is “Canienga.” The practice of speaking without
ever closing the lips is an acquired habit of later origin
than the forms of the parent tongue. A comparison of any of
the Iroquois dialects with the Huron as still spoken by the
Wyandots of Ontario, shows the <span class='it'>m</span> in use by the latter in what
is no doubt a surviving example of the oldest form of the
Huron-Iroquois language. This Huron <span class='it'>m</span> frequently becomes
<span class='it'>w</span> in the Iroquois dialects, <span class='it'>e.g.</span> <span class='it'>skatamendjaweh</span>, “one hundred,”
becomes in Mohawk <span class='it'>unskadewennyaweh</span>; <span class='it'>rume</span>, “man,” Mohawk,
<span class='it'>ronkwe</span>, etc. These and other examples of this interchangeable
characteristic of Indian phonology, and the process of substitution
in the absence of labials, are illustrated in the table of
Huron-Iroquois numerals on the following page. The habit of
invariably speaking with the lips open is the source of very
curious modifications in the Iroquois vocabularies when compared
with that of the Wyandots. The <span class='it'>m</span> gives place to <span class='it'>w</span>,
<span class='it'>nw</span>, <span class='it'>nh</span>, or <span class='it'>nhu</span>; also to <span class='it'>ku</span> and <span class='it'>nkw</span>, and so frequently changes
the whole character of the word by the modifications it gives
rise to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A comparison of the numerals of cognate languages and
dialects is always instructive; and with the growing disposition
of American philologists to turn to the Basques, as the only
prehistoric race of Europe that has perpetuated the language
of an Allophylian stock with possible analogies to the native
languages of America, their numerals may be placed alongside
of those of the Huron-Iroquois. The permanency of the names
for numerals, and their freedom from displacement by synonyms,</p>

<p class='noindent'>are seen in the universality of one series of names throughout
the whole ancient and modern Aryan languages of Asia and
Europe. But the Basque numerals bear little or no resemblance
to either, unless such can be traced in the <span class='it'>bi</span>, “two,” and the <span class='it'>sei</span>,
“six,” as in the <span class='it'>assem</span>, “ten” (<span class='it'>decem</span>), of the old Hochelaga, the
<span class='it'>ahsen</span> of the later Wyandots. The <span class='it'>ehun</span> of the Basque has
also its remote, and probably accidental resemblance; but the
<span class='it'>milla</span>, “one thousand,” is certainly borrowed, and serves to
show that the higher numerals, with the evidence they afford
of advancing civilisation, were the result of intrusive Aryan
influences in the natives of the Iberian peninsula. With the
growing tendency to turn to the prehistoric Iberians of Europe
for one possible key to the origin of the races and languages
of America, it is well to keep this test in view for comparison
with the widely varying native numerals. But the correspondence
is slight, even with probable Turanian congeners. One
Biscayan form of “three,” <span class='it'>hirun</span>, is not unlike the Magyar
<span class='it'>harom</span>; while the <span class='it'>eyg</span>, “one,” of the latter, seems to find its
counterpart in the inseparable particle that transforms the
Basque radical <span class='it'>ham</span>, “ten,” into the <span class='it'>hamaika</span>, “eleven.” But
such fragmentary traces are in striking contrast to the radical
agreement of Sanskrit, Zend, Greek, Latin, Celtic, Slavonic, and
Teutonic numerals. Mr. Hale has drawn my attention to the
curious manner in which the names of the first five Hochelaga
numerals in Cartier’s list are contracted and strengthened in
the modern Wyandot; and some of the modifications in the
Iroquois dialects are no less interesting. <span class='it'>Secata</span>, the Hochelaga
“one,” survives in the Onondaga <span class='it'>skadah</span>, while it becomes <span class='it'>skat</span>
in the modern Huron, the Cayuga, and the Seneca. But in
the compounded form of the Wyandot “one hundred,” <span class='it'>skatamendjawe</span>,
as in the Onondaga <span class='it'>skadahdewennyachweh</span>, the terminal
<span class='it'>a</span> reappears. <span class='it'>Tigneny</span>, the old form of “two,” is abridged and
strengthened to <span class='it'>tendi</span>; <span class='it'>asche</span>, “three” (originally, in all probability,
<span class='it'>aschen</span>, or, as still in use by the Hurons of Lorette, <span class='it'>achin</span>),
survives as <span class='it'>ahsunh</span> or <span class='it'>ahsenh</span> in nearly all the Iroquois dialects,
including the Tuscarora. In the Nottoway it is still discernible
in the modified <span class='it'>arsa</span>. The exceptions are the Seneca, where
it becomes <span class='it'>sen</span>, while one Wyandot form is <span class='it'>shenk</span>; which
reappears in the Seneca compounded form of “thirty,” <span class='it'>shenkwashen</span>.
<span class='it'>Honnacon</span>, “four,” loses both its initial and terminal
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>
syllables, and becomes <span class='it'>dak</span> in the Wyandot, and <span class='it'>keih</span> or <span class='it'>kei</span>, an
abbreviation of the Mohawk <span class='it'>kayerih</span>, in the Cayuga and the
Seneca dialects. The ancient form of “five,” <span class='it'>ouiscon</span>, has
partially survived in the Huron <span class='it'>ouisch</span>. It becomes <span class='it'>wisk</span>,
<span class='it'>whisk</span>, <span class='it'>wish</span>, or (in the Seneca) <span class='it'>wis</span>, in all the Iroquois dialects,—the
Wyandot and Cayuga once more agreeing in form. The
<span class='it'>ayaga</span>, “seven,” of the old Hochelaga, nearly resembles the
<span class='it'>jadah</span> of several of the Iroquois dialects, as in the Cayuga
<span class='it'>jadak</span>, in the Tuscarora <span class='it'>janah</span>, and in the Nottoway <span class='it'>oyag</span>;
whereas in the Wyandot it is <span class='it'>tsotaré</span>. The <span class='it'>adigue</span>, “eight,” in
its oldest form is <span class='it'>sadekonh</span> in the Mohawk, and <span class='it'>dekrunh</span> in the
Cayuga; with the substitution of the <span class='it'>l</span> for <span class='it'>r</span> it becomes <span class='it'>deklonh</span>
in the Oneida; and after changing to <span class='it'>tekion</span> in the Seneca, and
<span class='it'>nagronh</span> in the Tuscarora, it reappears in the Nottoway as
<span class='it'>dekra</span>. The ancient <span class='it'>madellon</span>, “nine,” curiously survives in
abridged form, with the substitute for the labial, in the Oneida
<span class='it'>wadlonh</span> and the Onondaga <span class='it'>wadonh</span>, while one Wyandot form
is <span class='it'>entron</span>, and that of the Hurons of Lorette <span class='it'>entson</span>. In the
Hochelaga <span class='it'>assem</span>, “ten,” we have the old form which is perpetuated
in the Wyandot <span class='it'>ahsen</span>, the Onondaga and Cayuga <span class='it'>wasenh</span>,
the Tuscarora <span class='it'>wasunh</span>, and the Nottoway <span class='it'>washa</span>; while the
Mohawk and the Oneida have the diverse <span class='it'>oyerih</span>, or <span class='it'>oyelih</span>, with
the characteristic change of <span class='it'>r</span> into <span class='it'>l</span>. The form of the Mohawk
for “one thousand,” <span class='it'>oyerihnadewunnyaweh</span>, is an interesting
illustration of the progressive development of numbers. <span class='it'>Na</span> is
probably a contraction of <span class='it'>nikonh</span>, “of them,” or “of it,”—the
whole reading “of them ten hundred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In comparing the languages of the different members of the
Iroquois confederacy with the Wyandot or Huron, some of the
facts already noted in the history of the former have to be
kept in view. Two and a half centuries have transpired since
the three western nations of the confederacy, the Onondagas,
Cayugas, and Senecas received great additions to their numbers
by the successive adoption of Attiwendaronk, Huron, and Erie
captives, while the Caniengas, or Mohawks, and the Oneidas
remained unaffected by such intrusions. There is direct evidence
that the Onondaga language has undergone great change; as
a Jesuit dictionary of the seventeenth century exists which
shows a much nearer resemblance between the Mohawk and
Onondaga languages at that date than now appears. Allowance
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>
must be made for similar changes affecting the Hurons
in their enforced migration from the St. Lawrence to their
later homes. Here, as in so many other instances, it becomes
interesting to note how the language of a people reflects its
history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In tracing out slighter and more remote resemblances, such
as may be discerned on a close scrutiny, where the variation
between the Hochelaga and the modern Wyandot numerals is
widest, the different sources of change have to be kept in view.
In all such comparisons, moreover, allowance must be made for
the phonetic reproduction of unfamiliar words learned solely by
ear, as well as for the peculiar representation of the nasal
sounds in their reduction to writing by a French or English
transcriber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tradition, mentioned by Dooyentate, of Senecas and
Wyandots living in friendly contiguity on the Island of
Montreal in the sixteenth century, naturally suggests the
probability that their dialects did not greatly differ. Certain
noticeable resemblances between the Seneca and the Wyandot
numerals have been noted above, but it is only their modern
forms that are thus open to comparison; and in the process of
phonetic decay the Seneca has suffered the greatest change.
But after making every allowance for modifications wrought
by time, by adoption of strangers into the tribe, and other
internal sources of change, as well as for the imperfection
of Cartier’s renderings of the Hochelaga tongue, and for subsequent
errors of transcribers and printers, there still remains
satisfactory evidence of relationship between nearly half of
Cartier’s vocabulary and the corresponding words of the
Wyandot tongue. A comparison has been made between the
Hochelaga numerals and those of the Wyandots of Anderdon.
In the comparative table of numerals given on page <a href='#Page_292'>292</a>,
I have placed alongside of the old Hochelaga series derived
from Cartier’s lists those now in use among the Hurons of
Lorette, as supplied to me by M. Paul Picard, the son of the
late Huron chief. In the third column another version of the
Wyandot numerals is given, from Gallatin’s comparative
vocabulary. It is derived from different sources, including the
United States War Department; and therefore, no doubt,
illustrates the changes which the language has undergone
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>
among the Wyandots on their remote Texas reserve. Gallatin
also gives another version of Huron numerals derived from
Sagard. It will be seen that M. Picard used the <span class='it'>t</span> as in
Cartier’s lists, and in that of the southern Wyandots, where
the <span class='it'>d</span> is employed in others, except in the Nottoway numerals,
where the use of both is, no doubt, due to the English
transcriber. In comparing the different lists, this variation
in orthography and also the interchangeable <span class='it'>k</span> and <span class='it'>g</span> have to
be kept in view. Thus the Cayuga has <span class='it'>dekrunh</span>, in the Oneida
<span class='it'>dekelonh</span>, where the Tuscarora has <span class='it'>nagronh</span>. But the Huron
<span class='it'>tendi</span>, in use now both at Lorette and Anderdon, shows the
result of long intercourse with Europeans begetting an appreciation
of their discrimination between the hard and soft consonants.
Had the whole series been derived from one source, such
orthographic variations would have disappeared. The lists
have been furnished to me by the Rev. J. G. Vincent and M.
Picard, educated Hurons; L. A. Dorion, an educated Iroquois;
Dr. Oronhyatekha, an educated Mohawk; Mr. Horatio Hale;
and also from Gallatin’s valuable comparative tables of Indian
vocabularies in the <span class='it'>Archæologia Americana</span>. In the <span class='it'>Synopsis
of the Indian Tribes</span>, to which these vocabularies form an
appendix, Gallatin classed both the Tuteloes and the Nottoways,
along with the Tuscaroras, as southern Iroquois tribes. But
recent researches of Mr. Hale have established the true place
of the Tuteloes to be with the Dakotan, and not the Huron-Iroquois
family. It is otherwise with the Cherohakahs, or
Nottoways, whose home was in south-eastern Virginia, where
their memory is perpetuated in the name of the river on which
they dwelt. At the close of the seventeenth century they still
numbered 130 warriors, or about 700 in all; but twenty years
later, of the whole tribe only twenty souls survived. At that
date two vocabularies of the language were obtained, which
furnish satisfactory evidence of the correctness of their classification
among southern Iroquois tribes. Their numerals, as
shown in the tables, approximate, as might be anticipated, to
those of the Tuscaroras, at least in the majority of the primary
numbers; whereas those of the Tuteloes are totally dissimilar.
As to the Basque numerals introduced alongside of them in
the comparative tables, they only suffice to show that the pre-Aryan
language still spoken, in varying dialects, on both slopes
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>
of the Pyrenees, differed equally widely from the Aryan languages
of Europe, and from the Iroquois or any other known American
language, except in so far as the latter are agglutinative in
structure. Van Eys, in his <span class='it'>Basque Grammar</span>, draws attention
to the words <span class='it'>buluzkorri</span>, and <span class='it'>larrugori</span>, “naked”; the first of
which literally signifies “red hair,” and the second “red skin.”
They are interesting illustrations of the way in which important
historical facts lie embedded in ancient languages. But the
colour of the hair forbids the inference that the ruddy Basques
of primitive centuries were akin to the “Redskins” of the
New World.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The phonology of the Iroquois languages is notable in other
respects besides those already referred to. According to M.
Cuoq, an able philologist, who has laboured for many years as
a missionary among the Iroquois of the Province of Quebec,
the sounds are so simple that he considers an alphabet of
twelve letters sufficient for their indication: <span class='it'>a</span>, <span class='it'>e</span>, <span class='it'>f</span>, <span class='it'>h</span>, <span class='it'>i</span>, <span class='it'>k</span>, <span class='it'>n</span>,
<span class='it'>o</span>, <span class='it'>r</span>, <span class='it'>s</span>, <span class='it'>t</span>, <span class='it'>w</span>. The transliterations noticeable in the various Iroquois
dialects, follow a well-known phonetic law. Thus the <span class='it'>l</span>
and <span class='it'>r</span> are interchangeable, as <span class='it'>ronkwe</span>, “man,” in the Mohawk,
becomes in the Oneida <span class='it'>lonhwe</span>; <span class='it'>raxha</span>, “boy,” becomes <span class='it'>laxha</span>;
<span class='it'>rakeniha</span>, “my father,” becomes <span class='it'>lakenih</span>, etc. The same is
seen throughout the compound numerals from “eleven” onward.
The Cayuga and Tuscarora most nearly approach to
the Mohawk in this use of the <span class='it'>r</span>. A characteristic change of
a different kind is seen in the grammatical value of the initial
<span class='it'>r</span> in the Mohawk in relation to gender. For example, <span class='it'>onkwe</span>
is applied to mankind, as distinguished from <span class='it'>karyoh</span>, “the
brute.” It becomes <span class='it'>ronkwe</span>, “man,” <span class='it'>yonkwe</span> “woman.” So also
<span class='it'>raxah</span>, “boy,” changes to <span class='it'>kaxha</span>, “girl”; <span class='it'>rihyeinah</span>, “my son,”
to <span class='it'>kheyenah</span>, “my daughter,” etc. The change of gender is
further illustrated in such examples as <span class='it'>raohih</span>, his apple;
<span class='it'>raoyen</span>, his arrow; <span class='it'>ahkohih</span>, her apple; <span class='it'>ahkoyen</span>, her arrow;
<span class='it'>raonahih</span> (masc.), <span class='it'>aonahih</span> (fem.), their apples; <span class='it'>raodiyenkwireh</span>
(masc.), <span class='it'>aodiyenkwireh</span> (fem.), their arrows, etc. But this
arrangement of the formative element as a prefix is characteristic
of American languages, though not peculiar to them.
Thus <span class='it'>Seshatsteaghseragwekough</span>, Almighty God (literally, “Thou
who hast all power, or strength”), becomes, in the third person,
<span class='it'>Rashatsteaghseragwekough</span>.
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The vowel sounds are very limited. No distinction is
apparent in any Huron-Iroquois language between the <span class='it'>o</span> and
the <span class='it'>u</span>. In writing it the <span class='it'>e</span> and <span class='it'>u</span> sounds are also often interchangeable.
Where, for example, <span class='it'>e</span> is used in one set of the
Tuscarora numerals supplied to me, another substitutes <span class='it'>u</span> for
it wherever it is followed by an <span class='it'>n</span>; e.g. <span class='it'>enjih</span>, <span class='it'>unjih</span>; <span class='it'>ahsenh</span>,
<span class='it'>ahsunh</span>; <span class='it'>endah</span>, <span class='it'>undah</span>, etc. So also the word for “man” is
written for me in one case <span class='it'>onkwe</span>, and in another <span class='it'>unkweh</span>. It
requires an acute and practised ear to discriminate the niceties
of Indian pronunciation, and a no less practised tongue to
satisfy the critical native ear. Dr. Oronhyatekha, when pressed
to define the value of the <span class='it'>t</span> sound in his own name, replied “It is
not quite <span class='it'>t</span> nor <span class='it'>d</span>.” The name is compounded of <span class='it'>oronya</span>, “blue,”
the word used in the Prayer-Book for “heaven,” and <span class='it'>yodakha</span>,
“burning.” In very similar terms, Asikinack, an educated
Odahwah Indian, when asked by me whether we should say
Ottawa, or Odawa—the Utawa of Morris’s “Canadian Boat
Song,”—replied that the sound lay between the two,—a nicety
discernible only by Indian ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The euphonic changes which mark the systematic transitions
in the Mohawk language, though by no means peculiar
to it, cannot fail to awaken an interest in the thoughtful
student, who reflects on the social condition of the people
among whom this elaborated vehicle of thought was the constraining
power by means of which their chiefs and elders
swayed the nations of the Iroquois confederacy with an eloquence
more powerful and persuasive than that of many
civilised nations. They have been illustrated in the verb;
but the same systematic application of euphonic change through
all the transitions of their vocabulary is seen in the elaborate
word-sentences, so characteristic of the extreme length to
which the incorporating mode of structure of the Turanian
family of languages is carried in many of those spoken by the
American nations. The habitual concentration of complex ideas
in a single word has long been recognised, not only as giving
a peculiar character to many of the Indian languages, but as
one source of their adaptability to the aims of native oratory.
From the Massachusetts Bible of Eliot, Professor Whitney
quotes a word of eleven syllables; and Gallatin produces from
the Cherokee another of seventeen syllables. This frequently
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>
embodies a descriptive holophrasm, and so aids the native
rendering of novel objects and ideas into a language, the vocabulary
of which is necessarily devoid of the requisite terms.
But in such cases the agglutinative process is obvious, and the
elements of the compounded word must be present to the mind
of speaker and hearer. The English word “almighty” is itself
an example of the process. It becomes in the Mohawk Prayer-Book
<span class='it'>seshatsteaghseragwekonh</span>, from <span class='it'>seshatsteh</span>, “you are strong,”
and <span class='it'>ahkwekonh</span>, “all,” or “the whole.” When the missionaries
first undertook to render into the Mohawk language the Gospels
and Service-Books for Christian worship, it may be doubted if
many of their converts had ever seen a sheep. But they had
to reproduce in Mohawk this general confession: “We have
erred and strayed from Thy ways like lost sheep.” They did
it accordingly in this fashion: <span class='it'>Teyagwaderyeadawearyesneoni
yoegwathaharagwaghtha tsisahate tsiniyouht yodiyadaghtoeouh
teyodinakaroetoeha</span>, which may be literally rendered: “We make
a mistake, and get off the track where your road is, the same
as strayed animals with small horns.” The extreme literalness
of the rendering may probably strike the mind of the
English reader in a way that would not occur to the Indian,
familiar with such descriptive holophrasms. But it illustrates
a difficulty with which Eliot was very familiar when engaged
on his Massachusetts Indian Bible. In translating, for
example, the song of Deborah and Barak, where the mother of
Sisera “cried through the lattice,” the good missionary looked
in vain in the Indian wigwam for anything that corresponded
to the term. At length he called an Indian and
described to him a lattice as wicker-work, and obtained in
response a rendering of the text which literally meant:
“The mother of Sisera looked through an eel-pot.” It was
the only kind of wicker-work of which the Indian had any
knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evidences of an exceptional development of the æsthetic
faculty among the nations of the New World have already
been noted; but the Iroquois cannot be included among those
specially noticeable for their imitative powers, or in other ways
furnishing evidence of any highly developed artistic faculty.
They cannot compare in this respect with the Zuñi or others
of the Pueblo Indians, among whom the arts of long-settled
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>
agricultural communities have been developed for purposes of
ornament as well as utility; nor is their inferiority less questionable
when we compare them with some of the tribes of
the north-west coast and the neighbouring islands. Their
languages confirm this; for while, as Mr. Cushing has shown,
the Zuñi language possesses many words relating to art-processes,
the Iroquois and Algonkin dialects supply such terms
for the most part only in descriptive holophrasms, and not in
primitive roots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Iroquois, the word <span class='it'>kar</span> or <span class='it'>kare</span> signifies “to paint” or
“draw.” The initial <span class='it'>k</span> in Iroquois words is usually not radical,
and so rarely enters into composite terms. The root of <span class='it'>kar</span>, is
<span class='it'>ar</span> or <span class='it'>are</span>, which added to <span class='it'>kaiata</span>, or <span class='it'>oiata</span>, “living thing, person,
body,” makes <span class='it'>kaiatare</span>, “image” or “likeness,” <span class='it'>i.e.</span> “pictured
body,” or as a verb “to paint” or “depict anything.” To this
is added the verbal suffix <span class='it'>ta</span> or <span class='it'>tha</span>, which occasionally becomes
<span class='it'>stha</span>, and has different meanings, causative and instrumental.
The Mohawk supplies such words and terms of art as <span class='it'>ahyeyatonh</span>,
“to grave”; <span class='it'>rahyatonhs</span>, “an engraver”; <span class='it'>ahyekonteke</span>, “to paint”;
<span class='it'>rakonteks</span>, “a painter”; <span class='it'>s’hakoyatarha</span>, “an artist”; <span class='it'>rahkaratahkwas</span>,
“a carver”; <span class='it'>rateanakerahtha</span>, “a modeller,” or “one who
models figures in clay.” In the Iroquois version of the Gospel
of St. John, chap. viii. verse 6 reads thus: <span class='it'>Nok tanon ne Iesos
wathastsake ehtake nok rasnonsake</span> (more correctly, <span class='it'>rasnonkenh</span>)
<span class='it'>warate wahiaton onwentsiake</span>, lit. “But instead Jesus bent low
and with hand used, wrote,” or “engraved, on the earth.” The
version of the second commandment in the Mohawk Prayer-Book
affords another illustration, in the holophrasm <span class='it'>asadatyaghdoenihseroenyea</span>.
It is compounded of <span class='it'>ahsonniyon</span>, “make”;
<span class='it'>ahsadadonnyen</span>, “to make for yourself”; <span class='it'>kayadonnihsera</span>, “an
image” or “doll.” <span class='it'>Toghsa asadatyaghdoenihseroenyea, shekonh
othenouh taoesakyatayerea nene enekea karouhyakouh, neteas
eghtake oughweatsyakonh</span>, etc., lit. “Do not make an image or
idol for yourself, even anything like above in the sky, nor
below in the earth,” etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word <span class='it'>kaiata</span>, or <span class='it'>oiata</span>, as already noted, signifies “a
living thing, person,” or “body”; <span class='it'>kakonsa</span> or <span class='it'>okonsa</span>, is the
“face” or “visage”; and from those come many derivatives.
Bruyas gives <span class='it'>gaiata</span>, “a living thing”; <span class='it'>gaiatare</span> (or <span class='it'>kaiatare</span>)
“image,” and as a verb, “to paint.” There is also <span class='it'>gaiatonni</span>,
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>
“a doll” or “puppet,” <span class='it'>i.e.</span> “a made person,” from <span class='it'>oiata</span> and
<span class='it'>konnis</span>, “to make.” From the same root we may probably
derive <span class='it'>kiaton</span>, “to write,” as in the Iroquois Gospels, <span class='it'>wahaiaton</span>,
“wrote”; <span class='it'>kahiaton</span>, “it is written,” etc. The original meaning
was, no doubt, picture-writing, <span class='it'>i.e.</span> making images of things.
In the old Onondaga dictionary of the Jesuit Fathers is the
word <span class='it'>kiatonnion</span>, “I keep writing.” The same authority also
gives <span class='it'>guianatonh</span> (<span class='it'>kianatonh</span>), “I paint,” apparently from another
root, <span class='it'>oiana</span> (<span class='it'>kaiana</span>) “track, walk, gait,” etc., which has many
derivatives. The remarkable compass and minute nicety of
expression which the Iroquois grammar had acquired in the
various languages of the Six Nations, approximates to the
wonderful expansion effected on the crude Anglo-Saxon verb
by the evolution of the auxiliaries out of vague active
verbs. This has been effected through the habitual resort to
oratory as a source of combined action in the councils of the
tribes, which constituted one of the most remarkable characteristics
of this representative Indian stock. In this respect the
expressive flexibility and rhetorical aptitude of the Iroquois
languages stand out in striking contrast to the limited compass
of grammatical discrimination in those of Europe’s Scandinavian
and Teutonic races by whom the Roman empire was overthrown.
They had indeed their “tun-moot,” the council meeting of the
village community for justice and government; but the deliberations
on the moot-hill, though they embodied the germ of all
later parliaments, gave birth to no such development of
language. It is when entering on the history of the grand
constitutional struggle for a free parliament that Carlyle, in
quaint irony, exclaims, or assigns to his apocryphal Dryasdust
the exclamation: “I have known nations altogether destitute
of printers’ types and learned appliances, with nothing better
than old songs, monumental stone heaps and quipo-thrums to
keep record by, who had truer memory of their memorable
things.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The English, one can discern withal, have been
perhaps as brave a people as their neighbours; perhaps, for
valour of action and true hard labour in this earth, since brave
peoples were first made in it, there has been none braver any
where or any when:—but also, it must be owned, in stupidity
of speech they have no fellow!”<a id='r146'/><a href='#f146' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[146]</span></sup></a> It suited the purpose of
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>
the satirist to ignore for the moment that Shakespeare came
of that same speechless race. But in its earlier stage when
any comparison with Indian nations is permissible the irony
is not extravagant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But apart from the great compass of the Iroquois verb as
illustrative of grammatical development in the languages of
unlettered nations, another characteristic feature is the distinction
between masculine and feminine forms both in speaking
of and to a man or woman. In the study of the minute
niceties of the Iroquois verb I have been largely indebted
to Dr. Oronhyatekha, and to the Rev. Isaac Bearfoot, both
educated Mohawks. When tracing out the comprehensive power
of the Mohawk verb, I had in view at the same time the recovery
of evidences that the language might supply of an inherent
recognition of the artistic faculty. This is much more strongly
manifested in other American races in all stages of progress,
from the ingenious Haidahs and Tawatins of British Columbia,
and the Pueblo Indians of Arizona, to the semi-civilised nations
of Mexico and the lettered races of Central and Southern
America. Nevertheless the Iroquois recorded in primitive
picture-writing the deeds of their departed braves, and have
left records in the same crude hieroglyphics, such as the graven
rock on Cunningham Island, Lake Erie. Their pipes were
carved, and their pottery modelled into representations of
familiar objects indicative of a habitual, though simple practice
of imitative art that could not fail to beget some counterpart
in their languages. Hence the choice of the verb <span class='it'>kyadarahste</span>,
“to draw.” <span class='it'>Kayadareh</span>, or <span class='it'>kyadareh</span>, signifies “a body or form
<span class='it'>in</span>,” <span class='it'>e.g.</span> “in a frame” or “group”; <span class='it'>kyadarastonh</span>, on the other
hand, implies “a body” or “form transferred <span class='it'>on</span> to something,”
<span class='it'>e.g.</span> a board or canvas. The latter is therefore the more
expressive and correct term to use for drawing or painting,
while it illustrates the process of augmenting the vocabulary to
meet the requirements of novel acquisitions in art. But its
chief value consists in its affording illustration not only of the
inherent capacity of the language to express with minute nicety
of detail the manifestations of an æsthetic faculty, as yet very
partially developed, but of the compass of its grammar to indicate
every distinctive variation of form expressive of time,
place, action, object, or subject. The latest results of philological
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>
research in this direction are set forth in the <span class='it'>Lexique</span> and
the <span class='it'>Études philologique</span> of Abbé Cuoq, and in an admirable
<span class='it'>résumé</span> in Mr. Horatio Hale’s introduction to <span class='it'>The Iroquois
Book of Rites</span>.<a id='r147'/><a href='#f147' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[147]</span></sup></a> The systematic processes by which the moods
and tenses are indicated, either by changes of termination or
prefixed particles, or by both conjoined, are carefully indicated
by Mr. Hale; but he adds: “A complete grammar of this
speech, as full and minute as the best Sanscrit or Greek
grammars, would probably equal, and perhaps surpass those
grammars in extent. The unconscious forces of memory and
of discrimination required to maintain this complicated intellectual
machine, and to preserve it constantly exact, and in
good working order, must be prodigious.” This tendency to
elaborate niceties of discrimination is in striking contrast to
that of the modern cultivated languages of Europe; and it is
not without reason that it is spoken of as a “complicated
intellectual machine.” The contrast, for example, between the
Mohawk or other Iroquois verb, in all its complex variations,
and the extreme simplicity of the Anglo-Saxon verb, with only
its Indefinite and Perfect Tenses,—the former predicated either
of the present, or of a future time, and the latter of any past
time,—can scarcely fail to impress the thoughtful student who
keeps in view the relative civilisation of the Iroquois, and of
the English people at the period when Anglo-Saxon in its
purely inflectional stage was still the national language. The
English verb has since then acquired wonderful power and
compass by means of the auxiliary verbs; but its whole
tendency is at variance with the elaborations in number and
gender of the Iroquois verb. These are only partially
illustrated in the above example, and might easily have been
carried further. For example, the rendering of the Active,
Indicative, Past Progressive, with Feminine Object is really a
verb in the passive voice. To realise the full inflectional
niceties of such minute grammatical distinctions, the two
genders should be given; and also a mixed gender, <span class='it'>i.e.</span> the two
genders together, as the artists may consist of both sexes.
This is indicated in the two forms of the Future Indefinite, by
<span class='it'>eas’hakodiyadarahste</span>, “they (mas.) shall draw her,” <span class='it'>eayaktodiyadarahste</span>,
“they (fem.) shall draw her.” But a study of the
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>
paradigm of the Mohawk verb will be found to illustrate
in a variety of interesting aspects the process of unpremeditated
grammatical evolution among an unlettered people,
with whom the influence of oratory in the councils of the
tribe was one of their most powerful resources as a preliminary
to war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grand movement of the barbarian races of Northern
Europe in the fifth and following centuries is spoken of as the
wandering of the nations. The natural barriers of the continent
seemed for a time to have given way, and the unknown tribes
from beyond the Baltic and from the shores of the North Sea
poured into the valley of the Danube, and swept beyond the Alps
and the Pyrenees to the furthest shores of the Mediterranean
Sea. The physical geography of the New World presents
fewer barriers to be surmounted. But if the student of North
American ethnology spread before him a map of the continent,
and trace out the wanderings of the Huron-Iroquois, he must
revert in fancy to that remote era when confederated Iroquois
and Algonkins swept in triumphant fury through the wasted
valley of the Ohio, and repeated there what Goth and Hun did
for Europe, in Rome’s decline and fall. The long-settled and
semi-civilised Mound-Builders fled before the furious onset,
leaving the great river-valley a desolate waste. The barrier of
an old-settled and well-organised community, which, probably
for centuries, had kept America’s northern barbarians in check,
was removed, and the fierce Huron-Iroquois ranged at will over
the eastern regions of the continent, far southward of the North
Carolina river-valleys, where the Nottoways and Tuscaroras
found a new home. As to the Nottoways, they appear to have
passed out of all remembrance as an Iroquois tribe; yet it is
suggestive of a long-forgotten chapter of Indian history, that
the name is still in use among the northern Algonkins as the
designation of the whole Iroquois stock. The Nottawa saga is
doubtless a memorial of their presence on the Georgian Bay,
and the Notaway (<span class='it'>Náhdahwe</span>) river which falls into Hudson
Bay at James Bay, is so named in memory of Huron-Iroquois
wanderers into that Algonkin region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some portion of the ancient Huron stock tarried on the
banks of the St. Lawrence, in what is known to us now as
the traditional cradleland of those Canadian aborigines.
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>
Others found their way down the Hudson, or selected new
homes for themselves on the rivers and lakes that lay to the
west, till they reached the shores of Lake Erie; and all that
is now the populous region of Western New York was in
occupation of the Iroquois race. Feuds broke out between
them and the parent stock in the valley of the St. Lawrence.
They meted out to those of their own race the same vengeance
as to strangers; and the survivors, abandoning their homes,
fled westward in search of settlements beyond their reach.
The Georgian Bay lay remote from the territory of the
Iroquois, but the nations of the Wyandot stock spread beyond
it, until the Niagara peninsula and the fertile regions between
Lake Huron and Lake Erie were occupied by them, and the
Niagara river alone kept apart what were now hostile tribes.
But wherever the test of linguistic evidence can be obtained
their affinities are placed beyond dispute. On the other hand,
the multiplication of dialects is no less apparent, and in
many ways helps to throw light on the history of the race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Huron mother tongue still partially preserves the
labials which have disappeared from all the Iroquois languages.
The Mohawk approaches nearest to this, and appears
to be the main stem from whence other languages of the Six
Nations have branched off. But the diversities in speech of
the various members of the confederacy leave no room to
doubt the prolonged isolation of the several tribes, or “nations,”
before they were induced to recognise the claims of consanguinity,
and to band together for their common interest.
Some of the noteworthy diversities of tongue may be pointed
out, such as the <span class='it'>r</span> sound which predominates in the Mohawk,
while the <span class='it'>l</span> takes its place in the Oneida. In the Onondaga,
Cayuga, and Seneca, they are no longer heard. The last of
these reduces the primary forms to the narrowest range; but
beyond, to the westward, the old Eries dwelt, speaking, it may
be presumed, a modified Seneca dialect, but of which unfortunately
no record survives. As to the Tuscaroras and the
Nottoways, if we knew nothing of their history, their languages
would suffice to tell that they had been longest and most
widely separated from the parent stock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not without interest to note in conclusion that the
main body of the representatives of the nations of the ancient
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>
Iroquois league sprung from the Huron-Iroquois stock of
Eastern Canada,—after sojourning for centuries beyond the St.
Lawrence, until the traditions of the home of the race had
faded out of memory, or given place to mythic legends of
autochthon origin,—has returned to Canadian soil. At Caughnawaga,
St. Regis, Oka, and on the river St. Charles, in the
Province of Quebec; at Anderdon, the Bay of Quinté, and
above all, on the Grand river, in Ontario; the Huron-Iroquois
are now settled to the number of upwards of 8000, without
reckoning other tribes. If, indeed, the surviving representatives
of the aborigines in the old provinces of the Canadian
Dominion are taken as a whole, they number upwards of
34,000, apart from the many thousands in Manitoba, British
Columbia, and the North-west Territories. But the nomad
Indians must be classed wholly apart from the settlers on the
Grand river reserves. The latter are a highly intelligent,
civilised people, more and more adapting themselves to the
habits of the strangers who have supplanted them; and they
are destined as certainly to merge into the predominant race,
as the waters of their ancient lakes mingle and are lost in the
ocean. Yet the process is no longer one of extinction but of
absorption; and will assuredly leave traces of the American
autochthones, similar to those which still in Europe perpetuate
some ethnical memorial of Allophylian races.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span><h1>VII<br/> HYBRIDITY AND HEREDITY</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Four</span> centuries have now completed their course since the
discovery of America revealed to Europe an indigenous people,
distinct in many respects from all the races of the Old World.
There, as in the older historic areas, man is indeed seen in
various stages: from the rudest condition of savage life, without
any knowledge of metallurgy, and subsisting solely by the
chase, to the comparatively civilised nations of Mexico,
Central America, and Peru, familiar with some of the most
important arts, skilled in agriculture, and with a system of
writing embodying the essential germs of intellectual progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The western hemisphere, which was the arena of such
ethnical development, had lain, for unnumbered centuries,
apart from Asia and Europe; and so its various nationalities
and races were left to work out their own destinies, and to
develop in their own way whatever inherent capacities for
progress pertained to them. But this done, it was abruptly
brought into intimate relations with Europe by the maritime
discoveries which marked the closing years of the fifteenth
century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that date a constant transfer of races from the Old
to the New World has been taking place, alike by voluntary
and enforced migration; with results involving a series of
undesigned yet exhaustive ethnological experiments carried
out on the grandest scale. There alike has been tested to
what extent the European and the African are affected by
migration to new regions, and by admixture with diverse
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>
races. There can now be witnessed the results of a transference,
for upwards of three centuries, of indigenous populations
of the Old World to a continent where they have been subjected
to many novel geographical, climatic, and social influences.
There, too, has taken place, on a scale without any
parallel elsewhere, an intimate and prolonged intermixture of
some of the most highly cultured races of Europe with purely
savage tribes, under circumstances which have tended to place
them, for the time being, on an equality as hunters, trappers,
or explorers of their vast forest and prairie wilds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole question of heredity, its phenomena and results,
is now in process of review under the novel phases that affect
anthropology; and in this view the illustrations which the New
World supplies in reference to hybridity and absorption have
a distinctive value. The anthropologist recognises various
elements marking diversity of race in stature, colour, proportion
of limbs, conformation of skull, colour and other characteristics
of eye and hair. He also notes no less distinctively
the diverse intellectual and moral aptitudes. Noticeable as
are the diversities of national type in Europe, the range of
variation is trifling when compared with the conditions under
which the White, Red, and Black races have met and
intermingled in the West Indies and in North and South
America. The cultured and civilised races of Europe have
there united their blood with the African negro and the native
Indian savage; and both admixtures have been carried out on
so great a scale as to furnish indisputable data for determining
the question how far the half-breed is a mean between the
two parents; or if there is any inevitable preponderance of
one of them, with a tendency to revert to one or the other
type. The intermarriage of fair and dark races of the Old
World has gone on throughout the whole historic period,
with apparently resultant intermediate types. The Iberians
and “black Celts” of Western Europe, and the dark brunettes
of the Mediterranean shores, stand out in marked contrast to
the blondes of the Baltic shores. Whatever may be said of
other diversities of race, Professor Huxley is led to the opinion
that the Melanochroi, or dark whites, are not a distinct
group, but the metis resultant from just such a mixture of his
“Australioids” and his “Xanthocroi,” as has been going on
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>
for centuries on the American continent between the blondes
of Europe and the native olive-skinned American, and between
both of them and the dark African race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, on the other hand, many anthropologists insist on the
survival of distinct types, even among approximate races, as
shown in the remarkable persistency of the Jewish type, notwithstanding
the modifications that have resulted from intermarriage
with fair and dark races of many lands. Dr. F. von
Luschan, in describing the Tachtadschy,<a id='r148'/><a href='#f148' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[148]</span></sup></a> calls attention to the
fact that the Greeks of Lycia represent a mixture of two
distinct types. From this he draws the following inference:
“At first glance it appears remarkable and hardly probable
that two disparate types should remain distinct, although
intermarriage has continued without interruption through
thousands of years. But we must acknowledge that it would
be just as remarkable if continued intercrossing should result
in the production of a middle type (<span class='it'>Mischform</span>). It is true
that at the present time the greater number of anthropologists
appear to be of the opinion that middle forms originate
wherever two distinct types live in close contact for a long
time. If this is true at all, it is true only in a very limited
sense, and still needs to be proven. <span class='it'>A priori</span>, we rather
ought to expect that one or the other of these types would
soon succumb in the struggle for existence. It would become
extinct, and give way to the other type; or both types might
continue to co-exist, although intercrossing might go on for
centuries. They would undergo no other changes than those
which each singly, uninfluenced by the other, would have
undergone by the agency of physical causes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence we possess of the physical characteristics of
the succession of races in Europe from palæolithic times is
already considerable; and in reference to neolithic and later
periods is ample. Within the recent historic period of the
decline and fall of Rome, and the influx of Northern and
Asiatic barbarians, the evidence of admixture of race is
abundant; and the physical, intellectual, and moral changes
resulting therefrom have stamped their ineffaceable impress
on history. But the conditions under which the meeting of
the Aryans with Allophylians, Neolithians, or other prehistoric
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>
races took place in older centuries, can only be surmised; and
the many analogies resulting from the intrusion of the European
races on the aborigines of the western hemisphere are
calculated to render useful aid in determining some definite
results.</p>

<p class='pindent'>History has familiarised us with the idea of sovereign and
subject races. The monuments of Egypt perpetuate the fact
from its remote dawn, Punic, Roman, Gothic, Frank, Saracenic,
and Scandinavian races, have in turn subdued others, and
made them subservient to their will. Evidence of a different
kind, but little less definite, points to the intrusion into
Europe in prehistoric times of races superior alike in physical
type, and in the arts upon which progress depends, to the
Autochthones, or primitive occupants of the soil. Further
indications have been assumed to point to the contemporaneous
presence, in primeval Britain, as elsewhere, of races of diverse
type, and apparently in the relation of lord and serf: a natural
if not indeed inevitable consequence of the intrusion of a
superior race of conquerors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in the New World the inaptitude of the native race
for useful serfdom largely contributed to the introduction there
of other and very diverse races from Africa and Asia; so that
now within a well-defined North American area, indigenous
populations of the three continents of the Old World are displacing
its native races. Still more, all three meet there
under circumstances which inevitably lead to their intermixture
with one another, and with the native races.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Various terms, such as Iberian, Silurian, Canstadt, Cimbric,
Finnish, and Turanian, have been applied to primitive types
as expressive of the hypothesis of their origin. But on turning
to the American continent we see vast regions occupied exclusively
until a comparatively recent period by tribes of
savage hunters, upon whom some of the most civilised races
of Europe have intruded, with results in many respects so
strikingly accordant with the supposed evolution of the
Melanochroi of the Old World, that we seem to look upon a
series of ethnological experiments prolonged through centuries,
with synthetic results to a large extent confirmatory of previous
inductions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intermingling of very diverse races at present taking
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>
place on the American continent includes some of widely
diverse types. There is seen the Portuguese in Brazil; the
Spaniard in Peru, Mexico, Central America, and in Cuba; the
African in the West Indies and the Southern States; the
Chinese on the Pacific; the Frenchman on the St. Lawrence;
the German, the Italian, the Norwegian, the Icelander, the
Celt, and the Anglo-Saxon: all subjected to novel influences,
necessarily testing the results of a change of climate, of diet,
and of social habits, on the ethnical character of each. There
too, alike in the Red and the Black races, we can study the
results of hybridity carried out on a scale adequate to determine
many important points calculated to throw light on the
origin and perpetuation of diverse races of mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The growth of a race of hybrid African blood has been one
of the results of the substitution at an early date of imported
negro slaves to supply the place of the rapidly disappearing
Indians who perished under the exactions of their taskmasters.
According to careful data set forth in the United States
census for 1850, the whole number of native Africans imported
cannot have exceeded 400,000. At present the coloured race—hybrids
chiefly—of African blood numbers nearly 7,000,000.
In 1715 there were 58,000 negroes in British America; in
1775, when the revolution broke out, there were 501,102.
After the epoch of independence the increase became more
rapid. In 1790 the numbers were 757,208; in 1800,
893,041; in 1810, 1,191,364. At the date of emancipation
in 1865 there were, in round numbers, in slavery, 4,000,000;
and at the census in 1880 the negro population in the United
States had risen to 6,580,793;<a id='r149'/><a href='#f149' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[149]</span></sup></a> and in the returns thus far
published relative to the later census of 1890, in the
Southern States alone they are reported to number 6,996,116;
so that with the added numbers of the Northern States and
Canada they can fall little short of 8,000,000. Of this
numerous intrusive race, the larger number are hybrids; and,
as was inevitable, they include some small proportion of
mixed negro and Indian blood.<a id='r150'/><a href='#f150' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[150]</span></sup></a> But it is the Metis, or White
and Red half-breed, that constitutes the subject of special
interest here.
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Various causes have tended to beget more friendly relations
between the older colonists of New France, and at a later
date between those of British America and the native Indian
race, than have existed either in Spanish America or the
United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great North-West, with its warlike Chippeways, Crees,
Sioux, and Blackfeet; and beyond the Rocky Mountains its
Tinné, Babeens, Clalams, Newatees, Chinooks, Cowlitz, and
numerous other native tribes; had till recently been under the
control of the all-powerful fur-trading company of Hudson
Bay. The interests of the fur-traders stimulated them to fair
and honourable dealing with the native tribes; and while they
had no motive to encourage the Indians to abandon their
nomadic life for the civilised habits of a settled people, or even
to interpose in the wars which varied the monotony of the
Indians’ wild hunter-life, they had so thoroughly won the
confidence of the natives, that tribes at open enmity with each
other were ready to repose equal confidence in the Hudson
Bay factors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The late Paul Kane, author of <span class='it'>Wanderings of an Artist
among the Indians of North America</span>, informed me that when
travelling beyond the Rocky Mountains he found no difficulty
in transmitting his correspondence home, even when among
the rudest Flathead savages. His packet, entrusted to one of
the tribe, was accompanied with a small gift of tobacco, and
the request to have it forwarded to Fort Garry, or other
Hudson Bay fort. The messenger—Cowlitz, Chinook, Nasquallie,
or other Indian,—carried it to the frontier of his own
hunting-grounds, and then sold it for so much tobacco to some
Indian of another tribe; by him it was passed on, by like
process of barter, till it crossed the Rocky Mountains into the
territory of the Blackfeet, the Crees, and so onward to its
destination, in full confidence that the officers of the Hudson
Bay Fort would sustain the credit of the White Medicine-man
(for so the painter was regarded), and redeem the packet at its
full value in tobacco or other equivalent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The personal interests of the little bands of European fur-traders
thus settled in the heart of a wilderness, and surrounded
by savage hunters, no less strongly prompted them to
exclude the maddening fire-water from the vast regions under
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>
their control. Guns and ammunition, kettles, axes, knives,
beads, and other trinkets, with the no less prized tobacco, were
abundantly provided for barter. Even nails and the iron
hoops of their barrels were traded with the Indians, and displaced
the primitive tomahawk and arrow head of flint or
stone. Thus, curiously, the Stone period of a people still in
the most primitive stage of barbarism has been superseded by
the use of metals obtained solely by barter, and without any
advance either in the knowledge of metallurgy, or in the
mastery of the arts which lie at the foundation of all civilisation.
Long before the advent of Europeans, the Chippeways
along the shores of Lake Superior had been familiar with the
native copper which abounds there in the condition of pure
metal. But they knew it only as a kind of malleable stone;
nor have they even now learned the application of fire in their
simple metallurgic processes. The root of their names for
iron and copper is the same abstract term, <span class='it'>wahbik</span>, used only
in compound words, and apparently in the sense of rock or
stone. <span class='it'>Pewahbik</span> is iron; <span class='it'>ozahwahbik</span>, copper, literally the
yellow stone. It formed no part of the Hudson Bay traders’
aim to advance him beyond the stage of a savage hunter. It
was incompatible with the interests of the fur-trader to teach
him any higher use of the rich prairie land than that of
a wilderness inhabited by fur-bearing animals, or a grazing
ground for the herds of buffalo which furnished their annual
supply of pemmican; or to familiarise him with more of the
borrowed arts of civilisation than helped to facilitate the
accumulation of peltries in the factory stores. Hence the
intrusive Europeans and the native tribes met on common
ground, engaged in the same pursuits, all tending to foster the
habits of hunter-life; and so presenting a close analogy to the
condition of Europe when, in its Neolithic age, its rude hunter
tribes were invaded by the Aryans. Thus engaged to a large
extent in the same pursuits, the Whites and Indians of the
Canadian North-West have dwelt together for successive
generations on terms of comparative equality, and with results
of curious interest, hereafter referred to, in relation to the
intermingling of the races.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the long-settled provinces of Canada it has been otherwise.
There the aborigines had to be gathered together on
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>
suitable reserves, and induced to accommodate themselves in
some degree to the habits of an industrious agricultural population;
or to be driven out, to wander off into the great
hunting-grounds of the uncleared West. The exterminating
native wars, which preceded the settlement of Upper Canada,
greatly facilitated this; and the tribes with which the English
colonists of Ontario have had to deal have been for the most
part immigrants, not greatly less recent than themselves. As
to the Six Nation Indians settled on the Grand River and at
the Bay of Quinté (the most numerous and the farthest
advanced in civilisation of all the Indians in the British provinces),
they are a body of loyalist refugees who followed the
fortunes of their English allies on the declaration of independence
by the revolted Colonies; and there is now in use,
at the little Indian Church at Tuscarora, the silver Communion
Plate presented to their ancestors while still in the valley of
the Mohawk, in the State of New York, the gift of Her
Majesty Queen Anne, “to her Indian Chappel of the
Mohawks.”<a id='r151'/><a href='#f151' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[151]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>But the civilisation which has thus resulted from prolonged
and intimate relations with the Whites, has been accompanied
by an inevitable admixture of blood, of which the results are
abundantly manifest in the physical characteristics of the
Indian settlers, both on the Grand river and at the Bay of
Quinté. The system of adopting members of other tribes,
including even those of their vanquished foes, to recruit their
own numbers, was practised by many of the North American
tribes, and was familiar to the Iroquois, or Indians of the Five
Nations, as they were styled before the admission of the
Tuscaroras to their confederacy. In 1649, for example, the
survivors of two of the Huron towns which they had ravaged,
besought the favour of the victors, and were adopted into the
Seneca nation. Nor did extreme differences of race interfere
with affiliation, as in the case of children kidnapped from the
White colonists in their vicinity. One interesting example of
the latter suffices to illustrate the extent to which such a
process tended to affect the ethnical purity of the race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the year 1779, while the Mohawks still dwelt in their
native valley in the State of New York, Ste-nah, a white girl,
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>
then about twelve years of age, was captured in one of their
marauding expeditions, and adopted into the tribe. In 1868,
while still living, she was described to me by an educated
Mohawk India, as a full-blood <span class='it'>Sko-ha-ra</span>, or Dutchwoman. She
grew up among her captors, accompanied the tribe on their
removal from the Mohawk valley to the shores of the Bay of
Quinté, and married one of the Mohawk braves. She had
reached mature years, and was the mother of Indian children,
when an aged stranger visited the reserve in search of his
long-lost daughter. He had heard of a captive white woman
who survived among the emigrant Mohawks there, and was
able, by certain marks, and the scar of a wound received in
childhood, to identify his long-lost daughter. But the discovery
came too late. As my Mohawk informant told me, she had
got an Indian heart. She had, indeed, lost her native tongue;
had acquired the habits and sympathies of her adopted people;
and coldly repelled the advances of her aged father, who in
vain recalled his long-lost daughter Christina in the Mohawk
white-blood, <span class='it'>Ste-nah</span>. If the date of her capture and her
estimated age can be relied on, she must have been in her
hundred and fifth year at the time of her death, in December
1871. I have received through one of her grandsons—himself
a Mohawk chief,—a genealogical table of her descendants,
from which it appears that there are at the present time fifty-seven
of them living and twenty-three dead. It is thus
apparent, that by the adoption of a single White captive into
the tribe, there are, in the fourth generation, fifty-seven survivors
out of eighty members of the tribe, all of them of
hybrid character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The influence of a single case of admixture of White blood,
thus followed out to its results in the fourth generation, suffices
to show how largely those tribes must be affected who dwell
for any length of time in close vicinity to White settlers, and
in intimate friendly relations with them. The earlier French
and English colonists, like the Hudson Bay traders of later
times, were mostly young adventurers, without wives, and
readily entering into alliance with the native women. The
children of such unions were admitted to a perfect equality
with the Whites, when trained up in their settlements; and in
the older period of French and English rivalry the Indians
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>
were dealt with on very different terms from those with which
they are now regarded, though even yet some memory of older
relations survives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the wars between the French and English colonists
to the north and south of the St. Lawrence, in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, the alliance of neighbouring Indian
tribes was courted; and the traditions of the fidelity of the
Hurons to the French, and the loyalty of the Iroquois to the
English, are cherished as incentives to the fulfilment of obligations
entered into on behalf of the little remnant of the Huron
nation remaining on the river St. Charles, below Quebec; and
to a liberal and generous policy towards the Six Nation
Indians settled on the Grand river and elsewhere in Western
Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But also in the primitive simplicity of border life, the half-civilised
Indian and the rude settler meet on common ground;
and in some cases the friendly relations established between
them have survived the more settled condition of agricultural
progress in the clearings. In this respect the older colonists
of Quebec fraternised far more readily with the native population
than has been the case with English settlers. The relations
in which the early French colonists stood to the Indians
of Lower Canada bore more resemblance to those of the fur-traders
of the North-West in later times, and were of a kindlier
nature than those of the intrusive European emigrants of the
present century. Prior to the accession of Louis XIV. to the
throne, the French possessions in the New World had been
regarded as little more than a hunting-ground to be turned to
the same account as the Hudson Bay Company’s territory;
and the peopling of Canada had given little promise of permanent
colonisation. Priests and nuns alone varied the usual
class of trading adventurers who resort to a young colony.
But soon after the King reached his majority, a systematic
shipment of emigrants to Canada was organised under the
direction of Colbert; sundry companies of soldiers were disbanded
in the colony; and then, at last, the necessity of finding
wives for the settlers was recognised. Thereupon a system
of female emigration, with bounties on marriage, was established.
Colbert, writing to the Canadian Intendant, tells him that the
prosperity of the people, and all that is most dear to them as
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>
colonists, depend upon their securing the marriage of youths
not later than their eighteenth or nineteenth year to girls
at fourteen or fifteen; and the next step was to impose a
fine on the father of a family who neglected to marry his
children when they reached the respective ages of twenty
and sixteen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up to this period the native women had chiefly supplied
wives for the colonists; nor was this element now ignored or
slighted. In the <span class='it'>Mémoire sur l’Etat Présent du Canada</span>, 1667,
it is stated: “At this time it was believed that the Indians,
mingled with the French, might become a valuable part of the
population. The reproductive qualities of Indian women therefore
became an object of attention to Talon, the Royal Intendant;
and he reports that they impair their fertility by nursing
their children longer than is needful; but, he adds, ‘this
obstacle to the speedy building up of the colony can be overcome
by regulations of police.’ ” Thus it is apparent that the
strongest encouragement was given to such alliances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The religious element, moreover, among a purely Roman
Catholic population, helped to foster a sense of equality in the
case of the Christianised Indian; while the gentler and less
progressive habits of the French habitants have tended to
prevent direct collision with the Indians settled in their midst.
Hence in the province of Quebec, half-breeds, and men and
women of partial Indian blood, are frequently to be met with
in all ranks of life; and slighter traces, discernible in the hair,
the eye, the cheek-bone, and peculiar mouth, as well as certain
traits of Indian character, suggest to the close observer remote
indications of the same admixture of blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while favouring influences in national character, political
institutions, and religion, all united to encourage a more
friendly intercourse between the native and European population
of Lower Canada, the circumstances attendant on the
settlement of new clearings have everywhere led in some
degree to similar results; and experience abundantly proves
the impossibility of preserving distinct two races living in
close proximity to each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the old provinces of Upper and Lower Canada,
and the Maritime Provinces, where the aborigines are mostly
congregated on reserves, under the charge of Government
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>
officers of the Indian Department, they appear, with few exceptions,
to have passed the critical stage of transition from a
nomadic state to that of assimilation to the habits of settled
industry of the Whites.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The native tribes of the old provinces of the Dominion,
though bearing a variety of names, may all be classed under
the two essentially distinct groups of Algonkins and Iroquois.
Under the former head properly rank the Micmacs, and other
tribes of Prince Edward’s Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick;
and the Chippeways, including Ottawas, Mississagas,
Pottawattomies, etc., of Ontario. Under the other head have
to be placed not only the Six Nations—Mohawks, Oneidas,
Onondagas, Cayugas, Senecas, and Tuscaroras,—but also the
Wyandots, or Hurons, both of Upper and Lower Canada;
though among the one were found the faithful allies of the
English, while the other adhered persistently to the French;
and to the deadly enmity between them was due the expulsion
of the Hurons from their ancient territory on the Georgian
Bay, and the extermination of all but an insignificant remnant,
including the refugees on the St. Charles river, below Quebec.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Canadian census of 1871 includes the aborigines in
the enumeration of the population of the Dominion, and states
the grand total of the Indians of the Provinces of Quebec,
Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, at 23,035.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the Indian population, gathered on their own reserved
lands under the care of Government superintendents, is not
diminishing in numbers, appears to be universally admitted.
But as, at the same time, the pure race is being largely replaced
by younger generations of mixed blood, the results cannot be
looked upon as encouraging the hope of perpetuating the native
Indian race under such exceptional conditions; nor can it be
overlooked that the increase is partly begot by the addition of
a foreign element. At best the results point rather to such a
process of absorption as appears to be the inevitable result
wherever a race, alike inferior in numbers and in progressive
energy, escapes extirpation at the hands of the intruders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the boyhood of the older generation of Toronto, hundreds
of Indians, including those of the old Mississaga tribe, were to
be seen about the streets. Now, at rare intervals, two or three
squaws, in round hats, blue blankets, and Indian leggings,
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
attract attention less by their features than their dress; for in
complexion they are nearly as white as those of pure European
descent. The same is the case on all the oldest Indian reserves.
The Hurons of Lorette, whose forefathers were brought
to Lower Canada after the massacre of their nation by the
Iroquois in 1649, are reported to have considerably increased
in numbers in the interval between 1844 and the last census.
But while the Commissioners refer to them as a band of Indians
“the most advanced in civilisation in the whole of Canada,”
they add that “they have, by the intermixture of White blood,
so far lost the original purity of race as scarcely to be considered
as Indians.” In their case this admixture with the
European race has been protracted through a period of upwards
of two centuries, till they have lost their Indian language, and
substituted for it a French patois. Were it not for their
hereditary right to a share in certain Indian funds, which
furnishes an inducement to perpetuate their descent from the
Huron nation, they would long since have merged in the common
stock. Yet the results would not thereby have been
eradicated, but only lost sight of. Their baptismal registers
and genealogical traditions supply the record of a practical,
though undesigned, experiment as to the influence of hybridity
on the perpetuation of the race, and show the mixed descendants
of Huron and French blood still, after a lapse of upwards
of two centuries, betraying no traces of a tendency towards
infertility or extinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Maritime Provinces the Micmacs are the representatives
of the aboriginal owners of the soil. Small encampments
of them may be encountered in summer on the Lower
St. Lawrence, busily engaged in the manufacture of staves,
barrel-hoops, axe-handles, and baskets of various kinds, which
they dispose of, with much shrewdness, to the traders of Quebec,
and the smaller towns on the Gulf. So far as I have seen, the
pure-blood Micmac has more of the dark-red, in contrast to the
prevalent olive hue, than other Indians. But the Micmacs of
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick reveal the same evidence of
inevitable amalgamation with the predominant race as elsewhere.
The Rev. S. T. Rand—a devoted missionary labouring
among the Indians of Nova Scotia,—on being asked to
obtain a photograph of a pure-blood representative of the
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
tribe, had some difficulty in finding a single example, and
stated that not one is to be found among the younger
generation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the old provinces the Indians are in the minority; but
the same process is apparent where little bands of pioneers
leave the settled provinces and states to begin new clearings,
or to engage in the adventurous life of hunters and trappers
in the far West. The hunter finds a bride among the native
women; and when at length the wild tribe recedes before the
growing clearing and the diminished supplies of game, it not
only leaves behind a half-breed population as the nucleus of
the civilised community, but it also carries away with it a like
element, increasingly affecting the ethnical character of the
whole tribe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same circumstances have continued, in every frontier
settlement, to involve the inevitable production of a race of
half-breeds. Even the cruellest exterminations of hostile tribes
have rarely been carried out so effectually as to preclude this.
In New England, for example, after the desolating war of
1637, which resulted in the extinction of the Pequot tribe,
Winthrop thus summarily records the policy of the victors:
“We sent the male children to Bermuda by Mr. William
Pierce, and the women and maid children are disposed about
in the towns.” Such a female population could not grow up
in a young colony, with the wonted preponderance of males,
and leave no traces in subsequent generations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing, then, that the meeting of two types of humanity so
essentially distinct as the European and the native Indian of
America, has, for upwards of three centuries, led to the production
of a hybrid race, it becomes an interesting question,
what has been the ultimate result? Has the mixed breed
proved infertile, and so disappeared; has it perpetuated a new
and permanent type of intermediate characteristics; or has it
been absorbed into the predominant European race without
leaving traces of this foreign element? These questions are
not without their significance even in reference to the policy in
dealing with the Indian settlements in old centres of population;
for the traces of this intermingling of the races of the
Old and New World are neither limited to frontier settlements
nor to Indian reserves.
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Among Canadians of mixed blood there are men at the
Bar and in the Legislature, in the Church, in the medical profession,
holding rank in the army, in aldermanic and other
civic offices, and engaged in active trade and commerce. A
curious case was recently brought before the law courts in
Ontario. A son of the chief of the Wyandot Indians settled
in Western Canada, left the reserves of his tribe, engaged in
business, and acquired a large amount of real estate and personal
property. He won for himself, moreover, such general
respect that he was elected Reeve of Anderdon by a considerable
majority over a White candidate. Thereupon his rival
applied to have him unseated, on the plea that a person of
Indian blood was not a citizen in the eye of the law. Fortunately
the judge took a common-sense view of the case, and
decided that as he held a sufficient property-qualification within
the county, the election was valid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That an Indian ceases to be such in the eye of the law,
and in all practical relations to society, when he becomes an
educated industrious member of the general community, and
competes not only for its privileges but for its highest honours, is
inevitable. But it is not with the Indian as with the Negro
mixed race. The privileges and the disabilities of the Indian
ward may both be cast off; but a certain degree of romance
attaches to Indian blood, when accompanied with the culture
and civilisation of the European. The descendants of Brant
and other distinguished native chiefs are still proud to claim
their lineage, where the physical traces of such an ancestry
would escape the eye of a common observer. Traces of Indian
descent may be recognised among ladies of attractive refinement
and intelligence, and with certain mental as well as
physical traits which add to the charm of their society. Similar
indications of the blood of the aborigines are familiar to
Canadians in the gay assemblies of a Governor-General’s receptions,
in the halls of Legislature, in the diocesan synods and
other ecclesiastical assemblies, and amongst the undergraduates
of Canadian universities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the condition of men and women of mixed blood,
admitted to all the privileges of citizenship, and mingling in
perfect equality with all other members of the community, is
in striking contrast to that of the occupants of the Indian
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span>
reserves, where they are settled, for the most part in isolated
bands, in the midst of a progressive White population. Such
a condition is manifestly an unfavourable one, and one, moreover,
which cannot be regarded as other than transitional.
They are confessedly dealt with as wards, in a state of
pupilage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A growing sense of the necessity for some modification of
this system has been felt for a considerable time; and in
1867 “An Act to encourage the gradual Civilisation of the
Indian Tribes,” received the royal assent. This Act avowedly
aims at the “gradual removal of all legal distinctions between
them and Her Majesty’s other Canadian subjects; and to
facilitate the acquisition of property, and of the rights accompanying
it, by such individual members of the said tribes
as shall be found to desire such encouragement, and to have
deserved it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the ultimate result of this will involve the disappearance
of the Indian as a distinct race is inevitable. He will be
absorbed into the dominant race; not to be displaced or driven
out of the community; but to be perpetuated, as the precursors
of the blonde Aryans of Europe still survive in the
“dark Whites” that now, in undisputed equality, enjoy all the
rights of citizenship of a common race. They will indeed constitute
but a small remnant of the nations of Euramerican
blood. That whole tribes and peoples of the American
aborigines have been exterminated in the process of colonisation
of the New World is no more to be questioned, than that
a similar result followed from the Roman conquest and colonisation
of Britain. Nevertheless, long and careful study of
the subject has satisfied me that a larger amount of absorption
of the Indian into the Anglo-American race has occurred than
is generally recognised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fully to appreciate this, it is necessary to retrace the course
of events by which America has been transferred to the descendants
of European colonists. At every fresh stage of
colonisation, or of pioneering into the wild West, the work
has necessarily been accomplished by hardy young adventurers,
or the hunters or trappers of the clearing. It is rare
indeed for such to be accompanied by wives or daughters.
Where they find a home they take to themselves wives from
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>
among the native women; and their offspring share in whatever
advantages the father transplants with him to this home
in the wilderness. To such mingling of blood, in its least
favourable aspects, the prejudices of the Indian present little
obstacle. Henry, in his narrative of travel among the Cristineaux
on Lake Winipagoos upwards of a century ago, after
describing the dress and allurements of the women, adds:
“One of the chiefs assured me that the children borne by their
women to Europeans were bolder warriors and better hunters
than themselves.” This idea recurs in various forms. The
half-breed lumberers and trappers are valued throughout Canada
for their hardihood and patient endurance; the half-breed
hunters and trappers are equally esteemed in the Hudson
Bay territory; and beyond their remotest forts Dr. Kane reported,
as his experience within the Arctic circle, that “the
half-breeds of the coast rival the Esquimaux in their powers of
endurance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Charles Horetskey, in his <span class='it'>Canada on the Pacific</span>, after
remarking on the well-known fact that Japanese junks have
been known to drift on to the Pacific coast of America, and so
contribute new elements of Mongolian character to the native
population, thus proceeds to notice another element of hybridity.
“There is,” he says, “another mixture in the blood
on the west coast of Vancouver Island, and a very marked one—the
Spanish, owing to the Spaniards having long had a
settlement at Nootka. Strangely enough, the Spanish cast of
countenance does not show in the women, who have the same
flat features as their sisters to the eastward. Nor is it so
noticeable among the young men, many of whom, however,
have beards—a most unusual appendage among American
Indians, and of course traceable to the cause referred to. The
features are more observable among the older men, many of
whom, with their long, narrow, pointed faces and beards, would,
if washed, present very fair models for Don Quixote.” Within
the region of Alaska, Russian traders have contributed another
element to the mingling of races; and Mr. Wm. H. Dall, in
his <span class='it'>Alaska and its Resources</span>, states specifically the number of the
Creoles or half-breeds of that region as 1421. But the present
condition of society there favours their increase. In 1842,
they were, for the first time, qualified to enter the Church as
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>
priests; and in 1865, the American Expedition found Ivan
Pavloff, the son of a Russian father and a native woman of
Kenai, filling the office of Bidarshik, or commander of the post
at Nulato. He was legally married to a full-blooded Indian
woman, by whom he had a large family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another intrusive element, that of the Asiatic Mongol, has
awakened alarm for the possible future of the white race of
settlers, both in America and in Australia. In 1875 the
number of Chinese in California amounted to 130,000;
19,000 arrived in a single year. They speedily made their
way to the New England States, and to Eastern Canada; till it
has been deemed politic to forbid further immigration. It is
the intrusion of a type approximating to the American Mongol,
and so has a special interest in its bearing on the ethnology
of the continent; for here we see the approximate types of
Asia and America brought into contact, it may be as descendants
of a common stock, separated through unnumbered
centuries by untraversed oceans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indians of Vancouver Island and British Columbia
were estimated in 1860 to number 75,000. The observations
of Paul Kane in 1846 showed that a considerable half-breed
population already existed then in the vicinity of every Hudson
Bay fort. But at the later date the reported richness of
the gold-diggings was attracting hundreds of settlers; and as
usual, in such cases, nearly all males. The admixture of blood
with the native population consequent on such a social condition
is inevitable; and though such a population is least
likely to leave behind it any permanent traces among settled
civilised colonists, yet the condition of things which it presents
illustrates the social life of every frontier settlement of the
New World. Everywhere the colonisation of the outlying
territory begins with a migration of males, and by and by the
cry comes from Australia, Canada, and elsewhere, for stimulated
female emigration. It is a state of things old as the dispersion
of the human race, and typified in such ancient legends
as the Roman Rape of the Sabines. The abstract of the
United States census of 1860 showed that the old settled
states of New England are affected even more than European
countries by this inevitable source of the disparity of the
sexes. In Massachusetts, at that date, the females outnumbered
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>
the males by upwards of 37,000; while in Indiana, on
the contrary, they fell short of the males by 48,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the latter case, on a frontier state, where the services of
the Indian women must necessarily be courted in any attempt
at domestic life, intermixture between the native and intruding
races is inevitable, and the feeling with which it is regarded
finds expression constantly through the genuine New World
lyrics of Joaquin Miller, with his “brown bride won from an
Indian town”—</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>Where some were blonde and some were brown,</p>
<p class='line0'>And all as brave as Sioux.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Thus the same process still repeats itself along the widening
frontier of the far West, which has been in operation on the
American continent from the days of Columbus and Cabot.
Hardy bands of pioneer adventurers, or the solitary hunter and
trapper, wander forth to brave the dangers of the prairie or
savage-haunted forest, and to such, an Indian bride proves
the fittest mate. Of the mixed offspring a portion cling to the
fortunes of the mother’s race, and are involved in its fate;
but more adhere to those of the white father, share with him
the vicissitudes of border life, and cast in their lot with the
first nucleus of a settled community. As the border land
slowly recedes into the further West, new settlers crowd into
the clearing; the little cluster of primitive log-huts grows up
into the city, perhaps the capital of a state, and with a new
generation the traces of Indian blood are well nigh forgotten.
If any portion of the aboriginal owners of the soil linger in the
neighbourhood, they are no less affected by the predominant
intruding race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The transfer of the rich prairie lands of the great North-West
from the care of Hudson Bay factors and trappers, the
organisation of it into the Province of Manitoba, and the
territories already in preparation for new provinces, under the
government of their own legislatures, has necessarily brought
to an end the condition of things so favourable to friendly
relations between the White and Red races. The region,
moreover, is now traversed by the Canadian Pacific Railway;
and the herds of buffalo, on which the Indian mainly depended
for his supplies of food, fur robes, and teepe skins, have finally
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span>
disappeared. Railways, telegraph lines, and other appliances
of civilisation are equally incompatible with the existence of
the wild buffalo and the wild Indian. The former inevitably
vanished from the scene. It remains to be seen if the latter
can adapt himself to the novel conditions of such an environment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As some preparation for the inevitable revolution, the
half-breeds, already numbering thousands, accustomed to mingle
on perfect equality with the Whites, and trained in some
partial degree to agricultural industry, entered on the possession
of farms allotted to them by the Government. But such a
transitional stage, forced into premature development, could
scarcely be expected to pass through all its revolutionary stages
without a conflict, and clashing of interests; and the efforts of
the Dominion Government to deal with this novel condition of
things were only partially successful. But perhaps the most
notable feature in the results has been that the chief difficulty
was, not with the wild tribes transferred from the management
of the fur-traders to the direct jurisdiction of the
Government, but with the half-breeds, claiming civil rights,
and jealously resenting encroachments on lands appropriated
for their own settlement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reports of the Indian Department supply interesting
glimpses of the process of adjustment with the various tribes
of natives reluctantly yielding to the new condition of things.
Returns made to an address of the House of Commons at
Ottawa, dated March 1873, disclose the jealousies and suspicions
of the native tribes, and the anxiety evinced by the
Government officials to remove all just grounds of complaint.
Mr. Beatty, a contractor for certain surveys on the Upper
Assiniboine, reports that the Portage Indians, under their
chief, Yellow Quill, had absolutely forbidden any survey of
their lands, and driven him and his party off the field. The
Lieutenant-Governor thereafter held an interview with Yellow
Quill and a party of his braves, and after a long <span class='it'>pow-wow</span>
succeeded in pacifying him. Again, a party of about two
thousand Sioux are reported to have left in high dudgeon,
with a threat to return in force next spring; and the Hon.
Alexander Morris—now Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba—writes
to the Provincial Secretary at Ottawa, that “The Red
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>
Lake Indians on the American side have been sending
tobacco to the Sioux in our territory, as it is believed, with
the view of common action with regard to the Boundary
Survey.” For the settlement of provinces, and the surveying
of the prairie for disposal to its new occupants, had necessitated
the determination of a well-defined boundary between
the Canadian territories and those of the United States.
Only a few years had elapsed since the State of Minnesota
was desolated by a cruel war, carried on by the Sioux at the
instigation, as was then affirmed, of Southern agents, with a
view to a diversion in favour of the South during the great
Civil War. A large number of the Sioux have since crossed
the boundary, and settled within the British lines; and the
Hon. Mr. Morris writes from Fort Garry in December last:
“Some of the Sioux assist the white settlers as labourers in
the summer. They have asked for land, and were led to
believe that they would be assigned a reserve, and, if so, they
would plant crops, and could then be removed from the settlement.”
But Mr. Morris specially draws the attention of the
provincial authorities to the excited state apparent among all
the Western tribes, and adds: “I believe it to be in part
created by the Boundary Commission. They do not understand
it, and think the two nations are uniting against them.”
The difficulties, however, were overcome; and the reports of
the Indian agents contain some curious illustrations of the
difficulties inevitable in the first attempt at transforming wild
Indian tribes into prairie farmers. One of them thus writes:
“The full demands of the Indians cannot be complied with;
but there is, nevertheless, a certain paradox in asking a wild
Indian, who has hitherto gained his livelihood by hunting and
trapping, to settle down on a reservation and cultivate the
land, without at the same time offering him some means of
making his living. As they say themselves: ‘We cannot
tear down the trees and build huts with our teeth, we cannot
break the prairie with our hands, nor reap the harvest, if we
had grown it, with our knives.’ ” But even among the wild
tribes of the prairies a great diversity in habits, and in
aptitude for the new life now forced upon them as their only
chance of survival, is apparent. The Portage Indians clung
to their old status as hunters living in their buffalo-skin
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>
lodges on the prairies; the St. Peter Indians form permanent
settlements, not only of birch-bark wigwams, but many of
them have built log-houses for themselves. Even among the
tribes already settling down to steady agricultural labour, such
as the Saulteux and the Swampies of Manitoba, a very great
difference both in sentiments and customs prevail. Thirty-four
Indian families from one tribe in Pembina are reported
by the agent as demanding their allocation of farms; the
chiefs and headmen of other tribes are in negotiation for
farming implements, stock, etc., and some of their demands
curiously illustrate the form in which the new life thus
opening up to them presents its most tempting aspects.
Hoes, axes, and other indispensable implements have been
readily granted to them. Ploughs, harrows, and oxen are in
request, and have been conceded or promised where the
Government agent is satisfied that they will be turned to
good account. But in special demand is “a bull and cow for
each chief, and a boar for each reserve.” The incipient idea
of the stock farm is indeed apparent in the universal demand
of all: “A promise,” says one of the agents, “which the
Indians never omit to mention, that they shall be supplied
with a male and female of each animal used by a farmer.”
But the transformation of the wild hunter into an industrious
agriculturist is a difficult process; and even in the new
generation, born under such changed conditions, the Indian
boy shows much greater aptitude for mechanical employments;
and takes more readily to the work of the carpenter than to
that of tilling the soil, which, so long as the Indian was its
lord, was practised exclusively by the women of the tribe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could the older condition of interblended prairie life have
been sufficiently long perpetuated, the results would far more
fully have presented results in close analogy to the intermingling
of Europe’s aboriginal and Aryan races in prehistoric
times. A settlement begun by Lord Selkirk in 1811,
was formed on the Red River within the area now embraced
in the Province of Manitoba. It consisted of hardy Orkney
men and Sutherlandshire Highlanders; and on the amalgamation
of the North-West and the Hudson Bay Companies,
the settlement received considerable additions to its numbers.
When at length the great fur Companies’ supremacy came to
<span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>
an end, the community numbered upwards of two thousand
whites, chiefly occupied in farming, or in the service of the
Company. At a later date, another settlement was formed on
the Assiniboine river, chiefly by French Canadians. In
those, as at the forts and trading-posts of the Hudson Bay
Company, the settlers consisted chiefly of young men. They
had no choice but to wed or cohabit with the Indian women;
and the result has been, not only the growth of a half-breed
population greatly out-numbering the Whites, but the formation
of a tribe of half-breeds, divided into two distinct bands,
according to their Scottish or French paternity, who kept
themselves distinct in manners, habits, and allegiance, alike
from the Whites and the Indians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This rise of an independent half-breed tribe is one of the
most remarkable results of the great, though undesigned,
ethnological experiment which has been in progress ever since
the meeting of the diverse races of the Old and New World
on the continent of America; and when the peculiar circumstances
which favoured this result came to an end, it became
a matter of great interest to note the most striking phases
presented by it, before they are effaced by the influx of
European emigration. I accordingly printed and circulated
as widely as possible a set of queries relative to the Indian
and half-breed population both of Canada and the Hudson
Bay territory; and from the returns made to me by Hudson
Bay factors, missionaries, and others, most of the following
results are derived. The number of the settled population,
either half-breed or more or less of Indian blood, in Red
River and the surrounding settlements was about 7200.
The intermarriage there has been chiefly with Indian women
of the plain Crees, though alliances also occur with the
Swampies (another branch of the Crees), and with Sioux,
Chippeway, and Blackfeet women. But the most noticeable
differences are traceable to the white paternity. The French
half-breeds have more demonstrativeness and vivacity, but
they are reported to take less readily to the steady drudgery
of the farm than those of Scotch descent. But, at best, the
temptations of a border settlement, with its buffalo hunts and
its chief market for peltries, were little calculated to develop
the industrious habits of a settled community; and the
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>
intrusion of farmers from the old provinces, and immigrants
from Europe, ignorant of their habits and wholly indifferent
to their interests, necessarily interfered with the healthful
process of transformation into a settled industrious community
of civilised half-breeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the results elicited by the inquiries are of value
in their bearing on the question of mixed races, and the
apparent tendency to develop permanent varieties; and all
the more so as the data thus obtained show the condition of
the North-West community immediately prior to the formation
of the Province of Manitoba, and the inauguration of the
revolution which inevitably followed in its train. The half-breeds
are a large and robust race, with greater powers of
endurance than the native Indian. Mr. S. J. Dawson, of the
Red River Exploring Expedition, speaks of the French half-breeds
as a gigantic race as compared with the French
Canadians of Lower Canada. Professor Hind refers in
equally strong language to their great physical powers and
vigorous muscular developments; and the venerable Archdeacon
Hunter, of Red River, replied in answer to my
inquiry: “In what respects do the half-breed Indians differ
from the pure Indians as to habits of life, courage, strength,
increase of numbers, etc.?” “They are superior in every
respect, both mentally and physically.” Much concurrent
evidence points to the fact that the families descended from
mixed parentage are larger than those of the whites; and
though the results are in some degree counteracted by a
tendency to consumption, yet it does not amount to such a
source of diminution on the whole as to interfere with their
steady numerical increase. One of the questions circulated
by me was in this form: “State any facts tending to prove or
disprove that the offspring descended from mixed White and
Indian blood fails in a few generations.” To this the Rev.
J. Gilmour answered: “I know many large and healthy
families of partial Indian blood, and have formed the opinion
that they are likely to perpetuate a hardy race.” The venerable
Archdeacon Hunter, familiar with the facts by long
residence as a clergyman of the Roman Catholic Church
among the mixed population of the Red River Settlement,
answered still more decidedly: “The offspring descended from
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>
mixed White and Indian blood does not fail, but, generally
speaking, by intermarriages it becomes very difficult to
determine whether they are pure Whites or half-breeds.”
Living, however, for many years among a people in whom
the Indian traits are more or less traceable, it is probable
that Archdeacon Hunter is less attracted by the modified,
ample black hair, the large full mouth, and the dark, though
gentle and softly expressive eye, which strikes a stranger on
first coming among any frontier population of mixed blood.
The half-breeds also retain much of the reserved and unimpressible
manner of the Indian; though a good deal of
intercourse with the native race has led me to the conclusion
that this is more of an acquired habit than a strictly
hereditary trait: a piece of Indian education akin to certain
habits of social life universally inculcated among ourselves.
When off his guard, the wild Indian betrays great inquisitiveness,
and when relaxing over the camp-fire after a laborious
day gives free play to mirth and loquacity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far, however, much that has been said applies to the
mixed population of the Red River Settlement, living on a
perfect equality with the white settlers, and constituting an
integral part of the colony. They are neither to be confounded
with the remarkable tribe of half-breed hunters, nor with the
Indians of mixed blood already described, on older Canadian
reserves. Remote as this settlement has hitherto been from
ordinary centres of colonisation, and inaccessible except through
the agency of the Hudson Bay Company, every tendency has
been to encourage the introduction of the young adventurer,
trapper, or <span class='it'>voyageur</span>, rather than the married settler. The
habits of life incident to the fur trade made the distinction less
marked between the Indian and the white man; and thus a
people of peculiar type grew up there as intermediate in
habits and mode of life as in blood from those of the old
settled provinces of Upper and Lower Canada. Much property
is now possessed by men of mixed blood. Their young
men have in some cases been sent to the colleges of Canada,
and, after creditably distinguishing themselves, have returned
to lend their aid in the progress of the settlement. Thus a
favourable concurrence of circumstances in all respects tended
to give ample opportunity for testing the experiment of intermingling
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>
the blood of Europe and America, and raising up a
civilised race peculiar to its soil. With the rapid influx of
emigrants; the settling of the prairie lands with a population
of yeomen farmers; and the rise of villages and towns along
the railways and river highways; the ultimate absorption of
this half-breed population, and its merging into the homogeneous
community that will ultimately be fashioned out of
a meeting of very diverse settlers, is inevitable. Icelanders
and Danes, Germans, Russians, Italians, French, Highland
crofters, and Irish Celts, are all being interfused into the new
community of which the half-breed element will form no
unimportant factor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a greater interest attaches to that other class of half-breeds
already alluded to, which the new order of things has
inevitably tended to efface, though not necessarily to eradicate,
as an element in the population of the future province.
Besides the civilised race of half-breeds, mingling on a perfect
equality with the Whites; brought up in many cases in full
enjoyment of such domestic training as the Hudson Bay factor
and hunter could furnish in the wilderness; there remained
apart from them a half-breed race, the offspring born to native
women as the inevitable results of such a social condition as
pertains to the occupants of the forts and trading-posts of that
remote region. These half-breed buffalo hunters were wholly
distinct from the civilised settlers, and yet more nearly related
to them than to the wild Indian tribes. They belonged to the
settlement, possessed land, and cultivated farms, though their
agricultural labours were very much subordinated to the claims
of the chase, and they scarcely aimed at more than supplying
their own wants. The two bands numbered in all between
6000 and 7000. Each division had its separate tribal
organisation and distinct hunting-grounds, extending beyond
the British American frontier. In 1849 the White Horse
plain half-breeds on the Strayenne river, Dakota territory,
rendered the following returns to an officer appointed to take
the census: “700 half-breeds, 200 Indians, 603 carts, 600
horses, 200 oxen, 400 dogs, and 1 cat.” This may illustrate
the general character of a people partaking of the nomad
habits of the Indian, and yet possessed of a considerable
amount of movable property and real estate. They are a
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>
hardy race, fearless horsemen, and capable of enduring the
greatest privations. They have adopted the Roman Catholic
faith, and specially coveted the presence of a priest with them
when on their hunting expeditions. The mass was celebrated
on the open prairie, and was prized as a guarantee of success in
the hunting-field. On such expeditions, it has to be borne in
view, they were not tempted by mere love of the chase or by
the prospect of a supply of game. Winter-hunting supplies to
the trapper the valued peltries of the fur-bearing animals; but
they depended on the summer and autumn buffalo hunts for
the supply of pemmican, which furnished one of the main
resources of the whole Hudson Bay population. The summer
hunt kept them abroad on the prairie from about the 15th of
June to the end of August, and smaller bands resumed the
hunt in the autumn. With this as the favourite and engrossing
work of the tribe, it is inevitable that farming could be
carried on only in the most desultory fashion. Nevertheless,
the severity of the winter compelled them to make provision
for the numerous horses and oxen on which the summer hunt
depended; and thus habits of industry and forethought were
engendered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The half-breed hunters regarded the Sioux and Blackfeet
as their natural enemies, and carried on warfare with them
much after the fashion of the Indian tribes that have acquired
fire-arms and horses; but they gave proof of their “Christian”
civilisation by taking no scalps. In the field, whether preparing
for hunting or war, the superiority of the half-breeds was
strikingly apparent. They then evinced a discipline, courage,
and self-control, of which the wild Sioux, Crees, or Blackfeet
are wholly incapable; and they accordingly looked with undisguised
contempt on their Indian foes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such are some of the most noticeable characteristics of this
interesting race, called into being by the contact of the
European with the native tribes of the forest and prairie.
With so many of the elements of civilisation which it is found
so hard to introduce among the most intelligent native tribes,
an aptitude for social organisation, and a thorough independence
of all external superintendence or control, there seems no
reason to doubt that here is an example of an intermediate
race, combining characteristics derived from two extremely
<span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span>
diverse types of man, with all apparent promise of perpetuity
and increase, if they could have been secured in the exclusive
occupation of the region in which they have originated. But
the railway has traversed the trail of the buffalo; and they
have been compelled to make their choice between conformity
to the industrial habits of agricultural settlers, or follow the
herds of the buffalo in search of some remote wilderness
beyond the shriek of the locomotive and the hail of the
pioneer immigrant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The inevitable revolution was not permitted to be inaugurated
without very practical protest. The Red River Expedition
of Sir Garnet Wolseley in 1870 was directed to put down a
revolt of the half-breeds, under their leader, Louis Riel,
resolute to oppose the intrusion of immigrant settlers. The
struggle was renewed in 1885 under the same leader, but with
the more legitimate grievance of neglected land claims, and
the assertion of their rights to property in the prairie lands
and on the river fronts. They were encountered by a Canadian
volunteer force; Batoche, their little urban stronghold, was
captured; and the North-West rebellion was brought to an
end. But it was freely acknowledged that, poorly armed and
ill-provided with the indispensable requisites for meeting a
well-organised force of militia, under an experienced British
soldier, General Middleton, they displayed unflinching courage,
and held out bravely against overwhelming numbers furnished
with the deadly appliances of modern warfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It could not be supposed that the invasion of the western
hemisphere by the wanderers from the later homes of the
Aryans beyond the Atlantic could reproduce in all respects
the old phenomena that marked the displacement of Europe’s
prehistoric races. But making due allowance for the changes
wrought on the Aryan stock by the civilising influences of
twenty centuries or more; and the consequent disparity
between them and the rude hunter tribes of the American forests
and prairies; much remains to aid us in the interpretation of
the past. Ethnological investigation and induction enable us
to realise the condition of Europe when its thinly-dispersed
population consisted of a dark-skinned race, small in stature,
and, as we may conceive, with hair and eyes of corresponding
hue. Sepulchral deposits and the chance disclosures in their old
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>
cave-shelters have made us familiar with their physical form.
Their modern representatives survive on the outskirts of
Europe’s civilised centres. Still more, their ethnical characteristics
have been perpetuated by the very same process as may
now be seen in progress in the frontier states of America and
the newest provinces of the Canadian Dominion. Not only are
the modern representatives of Europe’s Allophyliæ to be found
among the Lapps, Finns, and the Iberians of Northern and
Western Europe; but everywhere in the British Isles, and
throughout Western Europe, the Melanochroic elements stand
out distinctly from the predominant Xanthocroic stock, among
a people unconscious of any diversity of race. Here then
we see evidences of the intermingling and the partial absorption
of the Australioid savage of prehistoric Europe by the
later Xanthocroi, the product of which survives in the brunette
of Britain, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. In Britain
the contrasting characteristics of the diverse ethnical elements
attracted the attention of Tacitus in the first century of
our era. In Spain the Iberian still preserves the evidence
of an individuality apart from the Indo-European races in the
vernacular Euskara, while a large Moorish element in the
southern portion of the peninsula perpetuates the results of
another foreign intrusion and interblending of races within
historic times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The diversity apparent in some of the results of the meeting
of dissimilar races in the Old World and the New, is due to
the geographical characteristics of the two hemispheres. Alike
by sea and land, Europe could be entered by invading colonists,
gradually, and at many diverse points. Hence, the aggression
of the higher races may be assumed to have begun while the
difference between them and the aborigines of Europe was
much less than that which distinguishes the European from the
Bed Indian savage. The conquest would thus be protracted
over a period probably of many generations, and so would
involve no such collisions as inevitably result in the destruction
of savage races when brought into abrupt contact with
those far advanced in civilisation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the peculiar relations of the frontier populations of the
New World, and especially of the factors, trappers, and
<span class='it'>voyageurs</span> of the Hudson Bay Company, with the native tribes,
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>
helped to create a partial equality between the civilised
European and the savage, and so to beget results akin to
those which have left such enduring evidences of the mingling
of diverse races in the population of Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This accordingly suggests a question affecting the whole
relations of British and European colonists generally to the
native population of new lands settled and colonised by them.
Not only English, Scotch, and Irish, but German, Norwegian,
Icelandic, French, Polish, Russian, and Italian emigrants flock
in thousands to the New World, merge in the common stock,
and in the third generation learn to speak of themselves as
“Anglo-Saxon!” The investigations of ethnologists have well-nigh
put an end to the supposed purity of an Anglo-Saxon or
Anglo-Scandinavian population in all but the assumed purely
Celtic areas of the British Islands; and the latest system of
ethnical classification is based on the recognition of the
survival in the mixed population of modern Britain of a race-element
which still perpetuates an enduring influence derived
from aborigines of Europe anterior to the advent of Celt or
Teuton. The power of absorption and assimilation of a predominant
race is great; and ethnological displacement is no
more necessarily a process of extinction now than in primitive
times; though intermixture must ever be most easily effected
where the ethnical distinctions are least strongly marked, and
the conditions of civilisation are nearly akin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The permanent survival of a disparate type in America
perpetuating the evidences of the interblending of the Red
and White races may be doubted. That some ineffaceable
results will remain I cannot doubt; but the enormous disparity
in numbers between the millions of European nationalities,
and the little remnant of the native race brought in contact
with them, precludes the possibility of results such as have
perpetuated in the modern races of Europe elements derived
from some of its earliest savage tribes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has indeed been such a favourite idea with some physiologists
that in the undoubted developments of something like a
distinct Anglo-American type, there is a certain approximation
to the Indian, that Dr. Carpenter, in his <span class='it'>Essay on the Varieties
of Mankind</span>, lays claim to originality in the idea “that the
conformation of the cranium seems to have undergone a certain
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span>
amount of alteration, even in the Anglo-Saxon race of the
United States, which assimilates it in some degree to that of
the aboriginal inhabitants.” This he dwells on in some detail,
and arrives at what he seems to regard as an indisputable
conclusion, that the peculiar American physiognomy to which
he adverts presents a transition, however slight, toward that of
the North American Indian. But the long-cherished opinion,
to which Dr. Morton gave currency, of the existence of one
special type of skull-form common to the whole aborigines of
America, has been abandoned by all who have given any
attention to the evidence which Dr. Morton’s own <span class='it'>Crania
Americana</span> supplies. I doubt if the idea of such an approximation
of the Anglo-American to the Red Indian type
would ever have occurred to a physiologist of Canada or of
New England, to whom abundant opportunities for comparing
the Indian and Anglo-American features, and of noting the
actual transitional forms between the two, are accessible.
But if such examples can be clearly recognised, they may
be assigned with probability to a reverting to the type of
some Bed ancestress whose blood is transmitted to a late
descendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is otherwise with the millions of the Coloured
race who now constitute the indigenous population of the
Southern States. They are at home there in a climate to
which the White race adapts itself with very partial success.
The offspring of white fathers and of mothers of the African
races, they have multiplied to millions; and now with the
recently acquired rights of citizenship, and with the advantages
of education within their reach, the country is their own.
The very social prejudices against miscegenation protect them
from the effacing influences to which the Indian half-breed
is exposed by ever recurrent intermarriage with the dominant
race. As yet, there are discernible the various degrees of
heredity from the Mulatto to the Quinteron. But the
abolishing of slavery has placed the Coloured race on an
entirely new footing; and left as it now is, free to enjoy the
healthful social relations of a civilised community, and protected
by the very prejudices of race and caste from any
large intermixture with the White race, it can scarcely admit
of doubt that there will survive on the American continent a
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>
Melanocroi of its own, more distinctly separated from the
White race, not only by heredity, but also by climatic
influences, than the “dark Whites” of Europe are from the
blonde types of Hellenic, Slavic, Teutonic, or Scandinavian
stocks.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>Consistently</span> with the recognition of the brain as the organ of
intellectual activity, it seems not unnatural to assume for man,
as the rational animal, a very distinctive cerebral development.
One of the most distinguished of living naturalists, Professor
Owen, has even made this organ the basis of a system of
classification, by means of which he separates man into a
sub-class, distinct from all other mammalia. But while a
comparison between man and the anthropoid apes, as the
animals most nearly approximating to him in physical structure,
lends confirmation to the idea not only that a well-developed
brain is essential to natural activity, but that there is a close
relation between the development of the brain and the manifestation
of intellectual power; the distinctive features in the
human brain, as compared with those of the anthropomorpha,
prove to be greatly less than had been assumed under imperfect
knowledge. The substantial difference is in volume.
“No one, I presume,” says Darwin, “doubts that the large size
of the brain in man, relatively to his body, in comparison to
that of the gorilla or orang, is closely connected with his higher
mental powers”;<a id='r152'/><a href='#f152' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[152]</span></sup></a> and it might not unfairly be reasoned from
analogy, that the same test distinguishes the intellectual man
from the stolid, and the civilised man from the savage. A
careful study of the subject, however, shows some remarkable
deviations from such a scale of progression. Attention is
indeed directed to greatly more ample proofs of inequality
between the organic source of power and the manifestations of
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>
mental energy; as, for example, in the ant, with its cerebral
ganglia not so large as the quarter of a small pin’s head, displaying
instincts and apparent affections of wonderful intensity
and compass. Viewed in this aspect, “the brain of an ant is
one of the most marvellous atoms of matter in the world,
perhaps more marvellous than the brain of man.” Here,
however, we look on elements of contrast rather than analogy;
and seek in vain in this direction for any appreciable test of
the soundness of the popular belief in the size of the brain as a
measure of intellectual power. It is otherwise when we turn
to the anthropomorpha. There, alike in the scientific and in the
popular creed, very special and exceptional affinities to man
are admitted; and a careful study of their anatomical structure
tends to increase the recognised points of analogy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Lockhart Clarke, in a contribution to Dr. Maudsley’s
work on the Physiology and Pathology of Mind, gives a
minute description of the concentric layers of nervous substance
which combine to form the convolutions of the human
brain; and of the forms and disposition of the various nerve-cells
of which its vesicular structure consists. Comparing the
human brain with those of other animals, he says: “Between
the cells of the convolutions in man and those of the ape
tribe I could not perceive any difference whatever; but they
certainly differ in some respects from those of the larger
mammalia: from those, for instance, of the ox, sheep, or
cat.”<a id='r153'/><a href='#f153' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[153]</span></sup></a> Apart from the difference in volume (55 to 115 cubic
inches), the only distinctive features, according to Professor
Huxley, between the brain of the anthropomorpha and that
of man, are “the filling up of the occipito-temporal fissure;
the greater complexity and less symmetry of the other sulci
and gyri; the less excavation of the orbital face of the frontal
lobe; and the larger size of the cerebral hemispheres, as
compared with the cerebellum and the cerebral nerves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brain of the orang is the one which seems most nearly
to approximate to that of man. In volume it is about 26
or 27 cubic inches; or about half the minimum size of a
normal human brain. The frontal height is greater than in
that of other anthropomorpha; the frontal lobe is in all
respects larger as compared with the occipital lobe; and
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>
certain folds of brain-substance, styled “bridging convulsions,”
which in the human brain are interposed between the parietal
and occipital lobes, also occur, though greatly reduced, in the
brain of the orang; while they appear to be wholly wanting
in the chimpanzee, the gibbon, and other apes which superficially
present a greater resemblance to man. Referring to
the convolutions of the central cerebral lobe, Huschke says:
“With their formation in the ape, the brain enters the last
stage of development until it arrives at its perfection in man”;
and the higher class of brains may be arranged between the
extremes of poorly and richly convoluted examples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it must not be overlooked that, apart from structural
differences, relative, and not absolute mass and weight of brain
has to be considered, otherwise the elephant and the whale
would take the foremost place. “The brain of the porpoise,”
Professor Huxley remarks,<a id='r154'/><a href='#f154' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[154]</span></sup></a> “is quite wonderful for its mass,
and for the development of the cerebral convolutions”; but it
is the centre of a nervous system of corresponding capacity,
while as compared with the size of the animal, the brain is
not relatively large. Vogt states the weight of the human
body to be to the brain, on an average, as 36 to 1; whereas
in the most intelligent animals the difference is rarely less
than 100 to 1.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Assuming the existence of some uniform relation between
the size of the brain and the development of the intellectual
faculties, along with whatever is recognised as most closely
analogous to them in the lower animals, it might be anticipated
that we should find not only a graduated development of
brain in the anthropomorpha as they approximate in resemblance
to man; but, still more, that the progressive stages
from the lowest savage condition to that of the most civilised
nations should be traceable in a comparative size and weight
of brain. Dr. Carl Vogt, after discussing certain minor and
doubtful exceptions, thus proceeds: “We find that there is an
almost regular series in the cranial capacity of such nations
and races as, since historic times, have taken no part in
civilisation. Australians, Hottentots, and Polynesians, nations
in the lowest state of barbarism, commence the series; and no
one can deny that the place they occupy in relation to cranial
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>
capacity and cerebral weight corresponds with the degree of
their intellectual capacity and civilisation.”<a id='r155'/><a href='#f155' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[155]</span></sup></a> But the position
thus confidently assigned to the Polynesians receives no confirmation
from the evidence supplied by the measurements of
Dr. J. B. Davis, in his <span class='it'>Thesaurus Craniorum</span>; and a careful
study of the subject reveals other remarkable deviations from
such a scale of progression, not only in individuals but in
races. To these exceptional deviations, with their bearing on
the comparative capacity of races, the following remarks are
chiefly directed. The largest and heaviest brains do indeed
appear, for the most part, to pertain to the nations highest in
civilisation, and to the most intelligent of their number. But
this cannot be asserted as a uniform law, either in relation to
races or individuals. The more carefully the requisite evidence
is accumulated, the less does it appear that the volume of
brain, or the cubic contents of the skull, supply a uniform
gauge of intellectual capacity. In the researches which have
thus far been instituted into the characteristics of the human
brain among the lowest races, the development is in many
respects remarkable; and, as was to be expected, no organic
differences between diverse races of men have been traced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor C. Luigi Calori has published the results of a
careful examination of the brain of a negro of Guinea. It
presented the marked excess of length over breadth so
characteristic of the negro cranium; but in other respects it
corresponded generally to the fully developed European brain.
The distribution of the white and gray substances was the
same; the cerebral convolutions were collected into an equal
number of lobes; and the only special difference was that the
convolutions were a little less frequently folded, and the
separating sulci somewhat less marked than in the average
European brain. But even in those respects the complication
was great. The actual weight of the brain, according to
Professor Calori, was 1260 grammes, equivalent to 44.4
cubic inches. The complexity of convolution, and consequent
extension of superficies of the encephalon, appears to be an
essential element in the development of the brain as the
organ of highest mental capacity; and to the cerebrum,
apparently, the true functions of intellectual activity pertain.
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span>
Professor Wagner undertook the measurement of the convex
surface of the frontal lobe in a series of brains. The heaviest,
as a rule, had also the greatest development of surface. But
the two elements were not in uniform ratio. Some of the
lighter brains presented a much greater degree of convolution
and consequent extent of convex superficies than others
which ranked above them in weight. It is thus apparent
that in estimating the comparative characteristics of brains,
various elements are necessary for an exhaustive comparison.
Besides the functional differences of the cerebrum, cerebellum,
and pons varolii, they have different specific gravities, so that
brains of equal weight may differ widely in quality. Dr.
Peacock, taking distilled water as 1000, gives the values of
the subdivisions of the brain thus: cerebrum, 1034; cerebellum,
1041; pons varolii, 1040. Again, Dr. Sankey states
the mean specific gravity of the gray matter of the brain in
either sex as 1034.6, and of the white matter as 1041.2.
The variations from these results, as given by Bastian, Thurnam,
and others, are trifling. But it is significant to note
that recent researches show that where greater specific gravity
of brain occurs in the insane, it appears to be limited to the
gray matter.<a id='r156'/><a href='#f156' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[156]</span></sup></a> Professor Goodsir maintained that symmetry
of brain has more to do with the higher faculties than bulk of
form. It is, at any rate, apparent that two brains of equal
weight may differ widely in quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, the popular estimate embodied in such expressions
as “a good head,” “a long-headed fellow,” and “a
poor head,” like many other popular inductions, has truth for
its basis. Up to a certain stage the growth of the brain
determines the capacity of the skull. Then it seems as
though more complex convolutions accompanied the packing
of the elaborated cerebral mass within the fixed limits of its
osseous chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A comparison of races, based on minute investigation of an
adequate number of brains of fair typical examples, may be
expected to yield important results; but in the absence of
such direct evidence, the chief data available for this purpose
are derived from measurements of the internal capacity of
their skulls. Among English observers who have devoted
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>
themselves to this class of observations, the foremost place
is due to Dr. J. Barnard Davis, who, in 1867, summed up
the results of his extensive researches in a contribution to
the Royal Society, entitled “Contributions towards determining
the Weight of the Brain in different Races of Man.”<a id='r157'/><a href='#f157' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[157]</span></sup></a> Inferior
as such evidence must necessarily be, if compared with the
examination of the brain itself, nevertheless the number of
skulls of the different races gauged unquestionably furnishes
some highly valuable data for ethnical comparison. The
evidence, moreover, is obtained from a source in some respects
less variable than the encephalon; and will always constitute
a corrective element in estimating results based on direct
examinations of the brain. Dr. Davis, indeed, claims “that
the examination of a large series of skulls in ascertaining their
capacities and deducing from those capacities the average
volume of the brain, affords in some respects more available
data for determining this relative volume for any particular
race than the weighing of the brain itself.” The defect is,
that its most important results are necessarily based on the
assumption of a uniform density of brain; whereas some
notable ethnical differences, hereafter referred to, may prove
to be due to the fact that certain races derive their special
characteristics from a prevailing diversity in this very respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the extensive observations of Dr. Davis, as of Dr.
Morton, have a special value from the fact that each furnishes
results based on a uniform system of observation; for the
diverse methods and materials employed by different observers
in gauging the human skull have greatly detracted from their
practical value. In a communication by the late Professor
Jeffreys Wyman to the Boston Natural History Society,<a id='r158'/><a href='#f158' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[158]</span></sup></a> he
presented the results of a series of measurements of the
internal capacity of the same skull with pease, beans, rice,
flax-seed, shot, and coarse and fine sand. From repeated
experiments he arrived at the conclusion that the apparent
capacity varied according to the different substances used, so
that the same skull measured respectively, with pease 1193
centimetres, with shot 1201.8, with rice 1220.2, and with
fine sand 1313 centimetres. Professor Wyman was led to the
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>
conclusion that, for exactness, small shot, as employed latterly
by Dr. Morton, is preferable to sand, were it not for its weight,
which, in the case of old and fragile skulls, is apt to be
destructive to them. With a view to avoid the latter evil,
Dr. J. B. Davis has used fine Calais sand of 1.425 specific
gravity. The diversity in apparent volume, consequent on
the employment of different substances in gauging the internal
capacity of the skull, necessarily detracts from the value of
comparative results of Morton, Davis, and others. But the
elaborate measurements of their great collections of human
crania furnish reliable series of data, each uniform in system,
and sufficiently minute to satisfy many requirements of comparative
craniometry and approximate cerebral development.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without assuming an invariable correspondence in cubical
capacity and brain-weight, there is a sufficient approximation
in the cubical capacity of the skull and the average weight of
the encephalon to render the deductions derived from gauging
the capacities of skulls of different races an important addition
to this department of comparative ethnology. For minute
cerebral comparisons, however, it is apparent that much more
is required; and the special functions assigned to the various
organs within the cranium have to be kept in view. Of these
the medulla oblongata, in direct contact with the spinal cord,
is now recognised as the centre of the vital actions in breathing
and swallowing; and is believed also to be the direct source of
the muscular action employed in speech. Next to it are the
sensory ganglia, arranged in pairs along the base of the brain.
To the cerebellum, which the phrenologist sets apart as the
source of the emotions and passions embraced in his terminology
of amativeness, philoprogenitiveness, etc., physiologists now
assign the function of conveying to the mind the conditions
of tension and relaxation of the muscles, and so controlling
their voluntary action. But above all those is the cerebrum,
or brain-proper, consisting of two large lobes of nervous substance,
which in man are so large that, when viewed vertically,
they cover and conceal the cerebellum. To this organ is
specially assigned emotion, volition, and ratiocination. It is
the assumed seat of the mind; and, in a truer sense than the
skull—</p>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>The dome of thought, the palace of the soul;</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>if indeed it be not, to one class of reasoners, the mind itself.
Certain it is that no acute disease can affect it without a
corresponding disorder of the functions of mind; and with
this organ much below the average size, intellectual weakness
may always be predicated. But at the same time, it is
significant to note that the human brain, stinted in its full
proportions, and reduced to a seeming equality with the
anthropomorpha, exhibits no corresponding capacities or instincts
in lieu of the higher mental qualities. Microcephaly is the
invariable index, not of mere limited intelligence and mental
capacity, but of actual mental imbecility. If the augmentation
of the brain of the anthropomorpha from 55 to 115 cubic
inches be all that is requisite for the transformation of the
irrational ape into the reasoning man, it would seem to be in no
degree illogical to look for the accompaniment of the inversion
of the process by an approximation, in some instances, to
certain capacities and functions of the ape. But there are no
indications of this. In some examples of microcephaly, the
so-called animal propensities do indeed manifest themselves to
excess; but there is no reproduction of the animal nature,
instincts, or capacities, analogous to the scale of cerebral
development of the orang or chimpanzee. A microcephalous
idiot, who died at the age of twenty-two, in St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital, London, had a brain weighing only 13.125 oz., or
372 grammes. In describing this case, Professor Owen remarks:
“Here nature may be said to have performed for us the experiment
of arresting the development of the brain almost
exactly at the size which it attains in the chimpanzee, and
where the intellectual faculties were scarcely more developed.
Yet no anatomist would hesitate in at once referring the cranium
to the human species.” And so is it with the encephalon. The
brain of the chimpanzee is a healthy, well-developed organ,
adequate to the amplest requirements of the animal; whereas
the microcephalous human brain is inadequate for any efficient,
continuous cerebral activity: not merely limited in its range of
powers. Much, however, may yet be learned from a careful
attention to the imperfect manifestations of activity in certain
directions, in cases of microcephalic idiocy, and noting the
predominant tendency in each case, with a view to subsequent
examination of the brain. By this means it may be found
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>
possible to refer certain forms of mental activity to special
variations in the structure of the organ, or to distinct members
of the encephalon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Laennec exhibited to the Anthropological Society of
Paris a microcephalous idiot of the male sex, aged fourteen
years. “This child is entirely unconscious of his own actions,
and his intellectual operations are very few in number, and
very rudimentary. His language consists of two syllables, <span class='it'>oui</span>
and <span class='it'>la</span>, and he takes an evident pleasure in pronouncing them.
He takes no heed in what direction he walks. He would step
off a precipice, or into a fire.” Attention was specially directed
to the idiot’s hands: “The thumbs are atrophied, and cannot
be opposed to the other fingers. The palms of the hands have
the transverse creases, but not the diagonal—the result of the
atrophy of the thumbs. Hence the hand resembles that of the
chimpanzee. The dentition too is defective. Though fourteen
years of age, the child has only twelve teeth.” Here it is
curious to note the analogies in physical structure to the lower
anthropomorpha in other organs besides the brain, for it only
renders more striking the absence of any corresponding aptitudes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. J. Barnard Davis, in his interesting monograph on
<span class='it'>Synostotic Crania among Aboriginal Races of Man</span>, produces
some remarkable illustrations of the effect of premature ossification
of the sutures of the skull in arresting the full development
of the brain, and so rendering it unequal to the due performance
of its functions. “I have,” he says, “the cranium of a convict
who was executed on Norfolk Island, which I owe to the kindness
of Admiral H. M. Denham. This man was executed there
when that beautiful isle was appropriated to the reception of
the most dangerous and irreclaimable convicts from the other
penal settlements. It is a microcephalic skull, rather dolichocephalic,
of a man apparently about forty years of age. It
exhibits a perfect ossification of the sagittal and of the greater
portion of the lambdoidal sutures. The coronal suture is
partially obliterated at the sides in the temporal regions, and
can only be distinguished by faint traces in all its middle parts.
In this case there has not been any compensatory development
of moment in other directions. The calvarium is not abridged
in its length, which is 7.1 inches, equal to 179 millimetres;
probably it is a little elongated. It is, however, very narrow
<span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span>
being only 4.8 inches, or 122 mm. at its widest part, between
the temporal bones. So that the result is a very small, dwarfed,
almost cylindrical calvarium. The internal capacity is only 59
ounces of sand,<a id='r159'/><a href='#f159' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[159]</span></sup></a> which is equal to 71.4 cubic inches, or 1169
cubic centimetres.” Here is a skull considerably below the
lowest mean of the crania of any race in Morton’s enlarged
tables, or in the more comprehensive ones furnished in Dr.
Davis’s <span class='it'>Thesaurus Craniorum</span>. Another skull nearly approximating
to it is that of a Cole, one of the savage tribes of
Nagpore, in Central India, who are said to go entirely naked.
It is described in the supplement to the <span class='it'>Thesaurus Craniorum</span>
as that of “Chara,” a Cole farmer, aged fifty, and its internal
capacity is stated as 59.5 oz. av., equivalent to 71.7 cubic inches.
The Coles appear to be small of stature. The heights of three
of them, whose skulls are in the same collection, were respectively
5 ft. 5 in., 5 ft. 2 in., and 5 ft., and the average
internal capacity of five male skulls is only 66.6. The small
stature in this and others of the native races of Central India,
has to be taken into account in estimating the relative size of
the brain. But, after making all due allowance for this, the
Cole skulls are remarkable for their small size, being smaller
even than the ordinary Hindoos of Bengal. Yet one of them,
“Cootlo,” whose skull is among those included in the above
mean, commanded a band of insurgents in the Porahant rebellion
of 1858, and made himself a terror to the district.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The microcephalism of races, as well as of individuals, of
small stature, must not be confounded with the true microcephaly
of a dwarfed or imperfectly developed brain, which is
invariably accompanied with mental imbecility. The Mincopies
of the Andaman Islands are spoken of by Professor Owen as
“perhaps the most primitive, or lowest in the scale of civilisation,
of the human race.”<a id='r160'/><a href='#f160' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[160]</span></sup></a> Mr. G. E. Dobson, in describing
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>
his first visit to one of their “homes,” says: “Although none
of the tribe exceeded 64 inches in height, so that on first seeing
them we thought the shed contained none but boys and girls, I
was especially struck by the remarkable contrast between the size
of the males and females.”<a id='r161'/><a href='#f161' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[161]</span></sup></a> Dr. J. B. Davis has given, in the
supplement to <span class='it'>Thesaurus Craniorum</span>, the dimensions of a
male Mincopie skeleton in his collection. The age he assumes
to have been about thirty-five. The internal capacity of the
skull is 62 oz. (Calais sand), equivalent to 75.5 cubic inches,
and the entire height of the skeleton is 58.7 inches. It belongs,
says Dr. Davis, to a pigmy race, is small in all its dimensions,
and is particularly small in the dimensions of the pelvis. Of
their skulls, moreover, he adds, “it is somewhat difficult to
determine the sex with confidence. They are all small (but
this is a character of the race), they are delicate in development,
and they have that fulness of the occipital region, and smallness
of the mastoid processes, which are marks of femininism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Alfred R. Wallace connects the Mincopies with the
Negritos and Semangs of the Malay peninsula, a dark woolly-haired
race, dwarfs in stature. Dr. Davis says of the six
Mincopie skulls in his collection, four male and two female,
as well as of others which he has seen: “They are all remarkably
and strikingly alike, not merely in size but in form also.
They are all small, round, brachycephalic crania of beautiful
form.” Moreover, though classed as “lowest in the scale of
civilisation,” the Mincopies betray no deficiency of intellect.
The admirable photographs which illustrate Mr. Dobson’s
narrative show in the majority of them good frontal development.
The brain is not, indeed, relatively small. Their canoes
are made of the trunk of a tree, hollowed out; and Mr. Dobson
remarks: “The construction of their peculiar arrows and fish-spears
with movable heads exhibits much ingenuity, and the
use of no small reasoning power in adapting means to an end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are indeed too apt to apply our own artificial standards
as the sole test of intellectual vigour; whereas it is probable
that in the amount of acquired knowledge and acuteness of
reasoning many savage races surpass the majority of the
illiterate peasantry in the most civilised countries of Europe.
Mr. Wallace, in viewing the subject in one special light,
<span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span>
remarks: “The brain of the lowest savages, and, as far as we
yet know, of the prehistoric races, is little inferior in size to
that of the higher types of man, and is immensely superior to
that of the higher animals; while it is universally admitted
that quantity of brain is one of the most important, and
probably the most essential of the elements which determine
mental power. Yet the mental requirements of savages, and
the faculties actually exercised by them, are very little above
those of animals. The higher feelings of pure morality and
refined emotion, and the power of abstract reasoning and ideal
conception, are useless to them; are rarely, if ever, manifested;
and have no important relations to their habits, wants, desires,
and well-being. They possess a mental organ beyond their
needs.”<a id='r162'/><a href='#f162' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[162]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, however, it may be well to guard against the confusion
of two very distinct elements. The higher feelings of pure
morality and refined emotion are not manifestations of intellectual
vigour in the same sense as is the power of abstract
reasoning and ideal conception. It is not rare to find an
English or Scottish peasant with little intellectual culture or
capacity for abstract reasoning, but with an acutely instinctive
moral sense. On the other hand, among the criminal class,
it is by no means rare to find examples of wonderfully vigorous
intellectual power applied to the planning and accomplishing
of schemes which involve as much foresight and skill as many
a triumph of diplomacy; but which at the same time seem to
be nearly incompatible with any moral sense. Moreover, it is
needless to say that intellectual vigour and high moral principle
are by no means invariable concomitants in any class of society;
nor can they be traced to a common source. Mr. Wallace
recognises that “a superior intelligence has guided the development
of man in a definite direction, and for a special purpose”;
and such guidance involves much more than the mere evolution
of a higher animal organisation. But, appreciating as he does
the difficulties involved in any acceptance of a theory of evolution
which assumes man to be the mere latest outgrowth of
a development from lower forms of animal life, Mr. Wallace
points out that “natural selection could only have endowed
savage man with a brain a little superior to that of an ape,
<span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span>
whereas he actually possesses one very little inferior to that
of a philosopher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet neither Mr. Wallace, nor Professor Huxley when controverting
this argument, withholds a due recognition of the
activity of the intellect of the savage. No one indeed can have
much intercourse with savage races wholly dependent on their
own resources without recognising that, within a certain range,
their faculties are kept in constant activity. The savage hunter
has not merely an intimate familiarity with all the capabilities
and resources of many regions traversed by him in pursuit of
his game; his geographical information includes much useful
knowledge of the topography of ranges of country which he has
never visited. I found, on one occasion, when exploring the
Nepigon River, on Lake Superior, that my Chippeway guides,
though fully 500 miles from their own country, and visiting
the region for the first time, were nevertheless on the lookout
for a metamorphic rock underlying the syenite which
abounds there; and they made their way by well-recognised
land-marks to this favourite “pipestone rock.” While moreover
the Indian, like other savages, is devoid of much of what
we style “useful knowledge,” but which would be very useless
to him, he is fully informed on many subjects embraced within
the range of the natural sciences; and has a very practical
knowledge of meteorology, zoology, botany, and much else
which constitutes useful knowledge to him. He is familiar
with the habits of animals, and the medicinal virtues of many
plants; will find his way through the forest by noting the
special side of the trunks on which certain lichens grow; and
follow the tracks of his game, or discover the nests of birds,
by indications which would escape the most observant naturalist.
The Australian savage, stimulated apparently to an unwonted
ingenuity by the privations of an arid climate, is the inventor
of two wonderfully ingenious implements, the <span class='it'>wommera</span> or
throwing stick, and the <span class='it'>bomerang</span>, which, when employed by
the native expert, accomplish feats entirely beyond any efforts
of European skill. Moreover, as Professor Huxley remarks,
he “can make excellent baskets and nets, and neatly fitted and
beautifully balanced spears; he learns to use these so as to
be able to transfix a quartern loaf at sixty yards; and very
often, as in the case of the American Indians, the language of
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>
a savage exhibits complexities which a well-trained European
finds it difficult to master.” Again he goes on to say:
“Consider that every time a savage tracks his game he employs
a minuteness of observation, and an accuracy of inductive and
deductive reasoning which, applied to other matters, would
assure some reputation to a man of science, and I think we
need ask no further why he possesses such a fair supply of brains.
In complexity and difficulty, I should say that the intellectual
labour of a good hunter or warrior considerably exceeds that
of an ordinary Englishman.” Hence Professor Huxley is not
prepared to admit that the American or Australian savage
possesses in his brain a mental organ which he fails to turn to
full account. But without entering on the questions of evolution
and natural selection in all their comprehensive bearings,
it is still apparent that the brain of the savage is an instrument
of great capacity, employed within narrow limits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In estimating the comparative size of the brain, it is seen
to be necessary to discriminate between individuals or races
of small stature and cases of true microcephaly. On the other
hand, it is not to be overlooked that examples of idiocy are
not rare where the head is of a fair average size, and where
the mental imbecility is regarded as congenital. But in this
as in other researches of the physiologist, he is limited in his
observations mainly to the chance opportunities which offer
for study; and not unfrequently the prejudices of affection
arrest the hand of the student, and prevent a <span class='it'>post-mortem</span>
examination in cases where science has much to hope for from
freedom of investigation. Hence the data thus far accumulated
in evidence of the actual structure, size, and weight, of the
human brain fall far short of what is requisite for a solution
of many questions in reference to the relations between cerebration
and mental activity. From time to time men of science
have sought by example, as well as by precept, to lessen such
impediments to scientific research. Dr. Dalton left instructions
for a <span class='it'>post-mortem</span> examination in order to test the peculiarity
of his vision, which he had assumed to be due to a colouring
of the vitreous humour; Jeremy Bentham bequeathed his
body to his friend Dr. Southwood Smith, for the purposes of
anatomical science; and the will of Harriet Martineau contained
this provision: “It is my desire, from an interest in
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span>
the progress of scientific investigation, that my skull should
be given to Henry George Atkinson, of Upper Gloucester Place,
London, and also my brain, if my death should take place
within such distance of his then present abode as to enable
him to have it for purposes of scientific investigation.” The
will is dated March 10, 1864; but by a codicil, dated
October 5, 1871, this direction is revoked, with the explanation
which follows in these words: “I wish to leave it on
record that this alteration in my testamentary directions is
not caused by any change of opinion as to the importance of
scientific observation on such subjects, but is made in consequence
merely of a change of circumstances in my individual
case.” The natural repugnance of surviving relatives to any
mutilation of the body must always tend to throw impediments
in the way of such researches; though it may be anticipated
that, with the increasing diffusion of knowledge, such obstacles
to its pursuit will be diminished. Thus far, however, notwithstanding
the persevering labours of Welcker, Bergmann,
Parchappe, Broca, Boyd, Skae, Owen, Thurnam, and other
physiologists, their observations have been necessarily limited
almost exclusively to certain exceptional sources of evidence,
embracing to a large extent only the pauper and the insane
classes; and in the case of the latter especially, the functional
disorder or chronic disease of the organ under consideration
renders it peculiarly desirable that such results should be
brought, as far as possible, into comparison with a corresponding
number of observations on healthy brains of a class fairly
representing the social and intellectual status of a civilised
community.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The average brain-weight of the human adult, as determined
by a numerous series of observations, ranges for man from 40
oz. to 52½ oz., and for woman from 35 oz. to 47½ oz. But
some indications among ancient crania tend to suggest a doubt
as to whether this difference in cerebral capacity was a uniformly
marked sexual distinction among early races; due
allowance being made for difference in stature. Dr. Thurnam
made the race of the British Long Barrows a special subject of
study; and Dr. Rolleston followed up his researches with
valuable results. Amongst other points, he noted that the
males appear to have averaged 5 ft. 6 in., and the females
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>
4 ft. 10 in. in height. But while the difference of stature
between the male and the female exceeds what is observable in
most modern races, the variation in the size and internal
capacity of their skulls appears to be less than among civilised
races. The like characteristics are noticeable in the larger
race of Europe’s Palæolithic era. Nothing is more striking in
the discovery of those ancient remains of European man than
the remarkable development of the skulls and the good brain
capacity of the race of the palæotechnic dawn, where man is
proved, by his works of art and all the traces of his hearth and
home, to have been still a rude hunter and cave-dweller. The
Canstadt type of skull is assumed to be that of the earliest
European race of which traces have thus far been discovered;
and it is unquestionably markedly inferior in development to
that of the artistic Troglodytes of the French Reindeer period.
Yet remarkable examples of atavism, as in the skull of St.
Mansuy, the missionary bishop of Toul, in Lorraine, in the
fourth century, and in that of Robert the Bruce, show a
reversion to this early type, in accompaniment with exceptional
intellectual capacity. The Neanderthal skull, an extreme
example of the primitive type, is pronounced by Professor
Schaaffhausen to be the most brutal of all human skulls;
though this impression is mainly due to the abnormal development
of the superciliary ridges, in which it undoubtedly
approximates to the chimpanzee or the gorilla. But it has an
estimated capacity of 75 cubic inches, and a corresponding
cerebral development in no degree incompatible with the idea
that the remains recovered from the Neanderthal cave may be
those of a skilled hunter; and one apt in the ingenious arts of
the primitive tool-maker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever other changes, therefore, may have affected the
brain as the organ of human thought and reasoning, it does not
thus far appear that the average mass of brain has greatly
increased since the advent of European man. Important
exceptions have indeed been noted. Professor Broca’s observations
on the cerebral capacity of the Parisian population at
different periods, based on nearly 400 skulls derived from
vaults and cemeteries of dates from the eleventh or twelfth to
the nineteenth century, appear to him to show a progressive
cerebral development in that centre of European
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
civilisation.<a id='r163'/><a href='#f163' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[163]</span></sup></a> But though the assumption is not inconsistent with
other results of civilisation, and is the necessary corollary of
the postulate that intellectual activity tends to development of
brain, the fact that the crania presented a still greater diversity
in type than in size reminds us of the intermixture of races on
the banks of the Seine, and the consequent necessity for much
more extended observations before so important a deduction
can be received as an established truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking the average brain-weight of the human adult as
already stated, all male brains falling much below 40 oz. or
1130 grammes, and female brains below 35 oz. or 990 grammes,
may be classed as <span class='it'>microcephalous</span>; and all above the maxima
of the medium male and female brain, viz. 52½ oz. or 1480
grammes, and 47½ oz. or 1345 grammes, may be ranked as
<span class='it'>megalocephalous</span>, or great brains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Welcker, who devoted special attention to the
whole subject under review, assumes another and simpler test
when he says that skulls of more than 540 to 550 millimetres,
or 21.26 to 21.65 inches in circumference—the weight of
brain belonging to which is 1490 to 1560 grammes (52.5-55
oz. av.)—are to be regarded as exceptionally large. But
while an excess of horizontal circumference may be accepted as
indicating good cerebral capacity, it must not be overlooked
that the adoption of it as the key to any definite or even
approximate brain-weight ignores the important elements of
variation involved in the difference between acrocephalic and
platycephalic head-forms. The volume of brain in Scott, and
probably in Shakespeare, appears to have depended more on its
elevation than its horizontal expansion. The same was also
the case with Byron. The intermastoid arch, measured across
the vertex of the skull from the tip of one mastoid process to
the other, furnishes an accurate gauge of this development.
Of thirteen selected male English skulls in Dr. Davis’s collection,
the mean of this measurement is 15.1; and of thirty-nine
male and female English skulls, it is only 14.4. Of the whole
number of eighty-one English skulls described in the <span class='it'>Thesaurus
Craniorum</span>, three exceptionally large ones are: No. 123, that
of an ancient British chief, of fully 6 ft. 2 in. in stature, from
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span>
the Grimsthorpe Barrow, Yorkshire; No. 905, a calvarium of
great magnitude, very brachycephalic, and with the elevation
across the middle of the parietals apparently exaggerated by
compression in infancy, from Hythe, Kent; and No. 1029,
another male skull, remarkable alike for its size and weight,
and with a peculiarity of conformation ascribed by Dr. Davis to
synostosis of the coronal suture. The intermastoid arch in
those exceptionally large skulls measures respectively 16.0,
16.2, and 16.9, whereas the same measurement derived from
the cast of Scott’s head taken after death, yields the extraordinary
dimensions of 19 inches. This last measurement is
over the hairy scalp. But after making ample allowance for
this, the vertical measurement of the skull and consequently of
the brain is remarkable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Full value has been assigned at all periods to the well-developed
forehead. It is characteristic of man. The physiognomist
and the phrenologist have each given significance to it
in their respective systems; and it has received no less
prominent recognition from the poets. A fully developed
forehead is assumed as distinctive of the male skull. But
Juliet, in <span class='it'>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</span>, when depreciating
her rival, exclaims, “Ay, but her forehead’s low”; and the
jealous Queen of Egypt, in <span class='it'>Antony and Cleopatra</span>, is told of
Octavia that “her forehead is as low as she would wish it.”
“The fair large front” of Milton’s perfect man is the external
index of an ample cerebrum: the organ to which the seat of
consciousness, intelligence, and will is assigned. It is therefore
consistent with this that a low, retreating forehead is popularly
assumed to be the characteristic index of the savage, and of the
unintellectual among civilised races. But the cerebral characteristics
of both ancient and modern civilised races have still
to be studied in detail; and the influence of race and sex on
the form of the head and the mass and weight of the brain,
involves some curious questions in relation to the oldest illustrations
of the physical characteristics of man, and to the effect
of civilisation on the relative development of the sexes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early observations led Dr. Pruner-Bey and other ethnologists
of France to recognise in certain ancient Gaulish skulls
of a brachycephalic type the evidences of a primitive race,
assumed to represent the inhabitants of France and of Central
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span>
Europe during its Reindeer period, and which appeared to be
assigned with reasonable probability to a Mongol origin. But
in the Cro-Magnon cavern, and in other caves more recently
explored, the remains of a race of men have been brought to
light markedly dolichocephalic, and no less striking in cranial
capacity. Dr. Broca speaks of these ancient cave-dwellers of
the valley of the Vézère as characterised by “sure signs of a
powerful cerebral organisation. The skulls are large. Their
diameters, their curves, their capacity, attain, and even surpass,
our medium skulls of the present day. The forehead is wide,
by no means receding, but describing a fine curve. The amplitude
of the frontal tuberosities denotes a large development of
the anterior cerebral lobes, which are the seat of the most noble
intellectual faculties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This primitive race of hunters, marked by such exceptional
characteristics, belonged to the remote Reindeer period of
Western Europe, and was contemporary with the mammoth,
the tichorine rhinoceros, and the fossil horse, as well as with
the cave-lion, the cave-bear, and other long-extinct carnivora
of Europe. The remarkable evidence of their intellectual
capacity has already been reviewed, in considering the manifestations
of the artistic faculty among primitive races. Their
weapons and implements, including carved maces or official
batons, as they are assumed to be, contribute additional evidence
of skill and latent capacity among a primitive race of hunters
and cave-dwellers. Dr. Broca, after a consideration of the
merits of their ingenious arts, says: “They had advanced to
the very threshold of civilisation”; and Dr. Pruner-Bey thus
comments on their characteristics: “If we consider that its
three individuals had a cranial capacity much superior to the
average at the present day; that one of them was a female,
and that female crania are generally below the average of <span class='it'>male</span>
crania in size; and that nevertheless the cranial capacity of the
Cro-Magnon woman surpasses the average capacity of male
skulls of to-day, we are led to regard the great size of the
brain as one of the more remarkable characters of the Cro-Magnon
race. This cerebral volume seems to me even to
exceed that with which at the present day a stature equal to
that of our cave-folks would be associated; whilst the skulls
from the Belgium caves are small, not only absolutely, but
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>
even relatively in the rather small stature of the inhabitants
of those caves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Canstadt head is undoubtedly an unintellectual type
suggestive of an inferior, though not necessarily an older savage
race; for the evidence of climate, contemporary fauna, and
other indices of the environments of the Cro-Magnon cave-dwellers,
all point to an early Post-Glacial era. Dr. Isaac
Taylor, in his <span class='it'>Origin of the Aryans</span>, assuming the priority of
the Canstadt man, speaks of him as “this primitive savage, the
earliest inhabitant of Europe.” The forehead in this type is
low and receding, and the cerebral capacity generally correspondingly
inferior. The relative superposition in some discoveries
of ancient human remains, as in the alluvium and
gravels of a former bed of the Seine, at Grenelle, lends confirmation
to the idea that in this poorly-developed cranial type
we recover the physical characteristics of the earliest type of
the European savage thus far brought to light. But no disclosure
of regular sepulture, or of implements or carvings
assignable to him, have hitherto furnished the means of determining
his condition or mode of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The disclosures of the rock-shelters in the valley of the
Vézère are, on the contrary, replete with interest, from the
evidence they furnish of a race of savage hunters, in whom
ingenious skill and great artistic aptitude gave evidence of
latent intellectual capacity of a high order. The remarkable
size of crania accompanying those examples of primitive art
seemingly pertaining to the Troglodytes of the Mammoth and
Reindeer periods of Central Europe, is the more significant from
its bearing on the evidence of progressive cerebral development
adduced by Dr. Broca from skulls recovered from ancient and
modern cemeteries of Paris. It appears, indeed, to conflict
with any theory of a progressive development from the Troglodyte
of the Post-Glacial age to the civilised Frenchman of
modern times. Professor Boyd Dawkins has accordingly been
at some pains in his <span class='it'>Cave Hunting</span> to show that the conclusions
formed by previous observers as to the epoch of their burial
are not supported by the facts of the case; and he sums up
his review of the whole evidence by expressing a conviction
that he “should feel inclined to assign the interments to the
Neolithic age, in which cave-burial was so common. The facts,”
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>
he adds, “do not warrant the human skeletons being taken as
proving the physique of the palæolithic hunters of the Dordogne,
or as a basis for an inquiry into the ethnology of the palæolithic
races. Professor Boyd Dawkins also pronounces the
same doubts in reference to the equally characteristic male
skeleton found in a cave at Mentone, and to others obtained in
the Lombrive and other caves. It is not to be overlooked that
the possibility of the intrusion of human remains into earlier
strata constitutes an important element suggesting caution in
reasoning from such evidence. For the remains of man differ
from those of other animals found in such series of deposits
as mark a succession of periods, in so far as they pertain to
the only animal habitually given to the practice of interment.
Human skeletons found under such circumstances may have
been artificially intruded long subsequent to the accumulation
of the breccia in which they lay. Happily, however, any
doubts as to the contemporaneity of the human remains with
the other cave relics has been removed by the discovery of
skeletons, similar in type, in other caverns in the same valley—and
especially in that of Laugerie Basse,—in positions which
seem to leave no room for questioning their being of the same
age as the works of art found along with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other examples of the ancient man of Europe show him in
like manner endowed with a cerebral development in advance
of the rudest races of modern times. The skull found by
Dr. Schmerling in the Engis cave, near Liège, along with
remains of six or seven human skeletons, was embedded in the
same matrix with bones of the fossil elephant, rhinoceros,
hyæna, and other extinct quadrupeds. It is a fairly proportioned,
well-developed dolichocephalic skull; and, like others
of the ancient human skulls of different types thus far found,
has signally disappointed the expectations of those who count
upon invariably finding a lower type the older the formation
in which it occurs. “Assuredly,” says Professor Huxley,
“there is no mark of degradation about any part of its structure.
It is, in fact, a fair average human skull, which might have
belonged to a philosopher, or might have contained the thoughtless
brain of a savage.” Even the famous Neanderthal skull,
of uncertain geological antiquity, but pronounced to be “the
most brutal of all human skulls,” acquires its exceptional
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span>
character, as already noted, chiefly from the abnormal development
of the superciliary region.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It is a universally accepted fact that the size of the male
head and the weight of the brain are greater than those of the
female. The average weight of the male brain is found to
exceed that of the female by about 10 per cent; or, as it is
stated by Professor Welcker, the brain-weight of man is to that
of woman as 100 to 90. But the difference of stature between
the two sexes has to be taken into account. The average,
based on various series of observations to determine the mean
stature for man and for woman, shows the latter to be about 8
per cent less than the former; or, as Dr. Thurnam has stated
it more precisely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here again, however, it becomes important to take into
consideration other elements of difference besides weight; for,
as Tennyson insists, “Woman is not undevelopt man, but
diverse.” The results of Wagner’s observations on the superficial
measurements of the convolutions of the brain point to
the conclusion that in the female the lesser brain-weight may
be compensated by a larger superficies. Ranked in the order
of their relative weights in grammes, six average brains of
men and women were found to stand thus:—</p>

<p class='noindent'>But, as already indicated, some modern disclosures tend to
raise the question whether the difference between the sexes, in
so far as relative volume of brain is concerned, has not been
increased as a result of civilisation. The disparity in size
between the Cro-Magnon male and female skeletons is quite as
great as that of modern times, but the capacity of the female
skull is relatively good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other observations, such as those of Professor Rolleston
“On the People of the Long Barrow Period,” seem to indicate
a nearer approximation in actual cranial capacity of the two
sexes in prehistoric times than among modern civilised races.
On the assumption that intellectual activity tends to permanent
development of brain, it is consistent with the conditions of
savage life that it should bring the mental energies of both
sexes into nearly equal play. They have equally to encounter
the struggle for existence, and have their faculties stimulated
in a corresponding degree. As nations rise above the purely
savage condition of the hunter stage, this relative co-operation
of the sexes is subjected to great variations. The laws of
Solon with reference to the right of sale of a daughter or sister,
and the penalties for the violation of a free woman, show the
position of the weaker sex among the Greeks at that early
stage to have been a degrading one. But the change was
great at a later stage; and much of our higher civilisation is
traceable to the early establishment of the European woman’s
rights, which Christianity subsequently tended to enlarge.
The position of woman among the ancient Britons appears to
have been one of perfect equality with man. Among the
Arabians and other Mohammedan nations, including the
modern Turks, the opposite is the case; and the whole tendency
of the creed of the Koran, and the social life among
Mohammedan nations, must be towards the intellectual atrophy
of woman. Hence it is consistent with the diverse conditions
of life that, in so far as cerebral development is the result of
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span>
mental activity, a much closer approximation is to be looked for
in the mass and weight of brain in the two sexes among savage
races, than among nations where woman systematically occupies
a condition of servile degradation, or of passive inertness.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Some interesting results of the actual brain-weights of
Negroes and other typical representatives of inferior savage
races have been published, including examples of both sexes;
and although the observations are as yet too few for the
deduction of any absolute or very comprehensive conclusions,
they furnish a valuable contribution towards this department
of ethnical comparison. In 1865, Dr. Peacock published the
results of observations on the brains of four Negroes and two
Negresses; and to those he subsequently added a seventh
example.<a id='r164'/><a href='#f164' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[164]</span></sup></a> Others are included in the following table. But I
have excluded some extremes of variation, such as the two
given by Mascagni, one of which weighed 1458 grammes, or
51.5 oz. av., and the other only 738 grammes, or 26.1 oz. av.
In addition to such actual brain-weights, Morton, Tiedemann,
Davis, Wyman, and others, have gauged the skulls of Negroes,
American Indians, Mincopies, Tasmanians, Australians, and
other savage races, as well as those of many civilised and semi-civilised
nations, and thereby contributed valuable data towards
determining their relative cranial capacity. In his
<span class='it'>Crania Ægyptiaca</span>, Dr. Morton, when discussing the traces of a
Negro element in the ancient Egyptian population, says: “I
have in my possession seventy-nine crania of Negroes born in
Africa, for which I am indebted to Drs. Goheen and M’Dowell,
lately attached to the medical department of the colony of
Liberia, in Western Africa; and especially to Don Jose Rodriguez
Cisneros, M.D., of Havana, in the island of Cuba. Of
the whole number, fifty-eight are adult, or sixteen years of age
and upwards, and give eighty-five cubic inches for the average
size of the brain. The largest head measures ninety-nine
cubic inches; the smallest but sixty-five. The latter, which is
that of a middle-aged woman, is the smallest adult head that
has hitherto come under my notice.”<a id='r165'/><a href='#f165' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[165]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The influence of race on the volume, weight, disposition,
and relative proportions of the different subdivisions of the
human brain, and so of brain on the character of races, has
thus far been very partially tested. But the diversities of
race head-forms—brachycephalic, dolichocephalic, platycephalic,
acrocephalic, etc.—are now well-recognised, though their relation
to cerebral development still requires much research for
its elucidation. The ancient Roman forehead, as illustrated
by classic busts, and confirmed by genuine Roman skulls, was
low but broad, and the whole head was platycephalic. The
Greek had a high forehead, and the works of the Greek
sculptors show that this was regarded as typical. But contemporary
with the classic races were the Macrocephali of the
Euxine and the Caspian Seas, who, like many modern tribes
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span>
of the New World, purposely aimed at depressing a naturally
receding forehead, and thereby exaggerated the typical forehead
characteristic of certain ancient barbaric races.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of hybrids the interchange of physical and
mental characteristics of the parents, including modifications of
head-form, is a familiar fact. The English head-form appears
to be an insular product of intermingled Briton, Teuton, and
Scandinavian elements, which has no continental analogue;
and its subdivisions, or sub-types, vary with the ethnical
intermixture. The Scottish head appears to exceed the English
in length, while the latter is higher. Where the Celtic
element most predominates, the longer form of head is found;
but even in the most Teutonic districts the difference between
the prevailing head-form and that of the continental German
is so marked that the latter finds it difficult to obtain an
English-made hat which will fit his head.<a id='r166'/><a href='#f166' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[166]</span></sup></a> Here the diversities
of head-form are accompanied with no less marked
differences of individual and national character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Welcker determined the average capacity of the
German male skull as 1450 cubic centimetres, equivalent to
88 cubic inches, and representing an average brain-weight of
49 oz. Dr. Davis, by a similar process, assigns to the Germans,
male and female, the larger mean brain-weight of
50.28 oz.; but by combining the means of both sexes, as
derived from his own tables and those of Huschke and Wagner,
we obtain a mean weight of German brain of 1314 grms., or
46.37 oz. The results of an extensive series of observations
by Dr. Broca, on the male French skull, yield a mean capacity
of 1502 cubic centimetres, or 91 cubic inches, representing an
average brain-weight of 50.6 oz. Morton, taking his average
from five English skulls, gives the great internal capacity of
96 cubic inches; while Davis arrives at a capacity of only 90.9
cubic inches from the examination of thirty-two skulls, male and
female; and for the Scottish and Irish, each of 91.2 cubic inches,
from an examination of thirty-five skulls. But unfortunately
the Davis collection, so rich in other respects, derived its chief
English specimens from a phrenological collection; and, along
with a few large skulls, contains “many small and poor
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span>
English examples.”<a id='r167'/><a href='#f167' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[167]</span></sup></a> The average weight of the English brain
may therefore, as Dr. Davis admits, be assumed to be higher
than the mean determined by him. “Still a comparison with
actually tested weights of brains shows that there cannot be
any material error.” The average brain-weight of twenty-one
Englishmen, as given by him, is 50.28 oz., that of thirteen
women is 43.13; and of the combined series, 47.50. The
results determined by the same process in relation to the
other nationalities of Europe are exhibited in detail in Dr.
Davis’s tables, printed in the <span class='it'>Philosophical Transactions</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such averages are, at best, only approximations to true
results; and when obtained, as in Morton’s English race, from
a very few examples, or in Davis’s, from exceptional skulls,
collected under peculiar circumstances or for a special purpose,
they must be tested by other observations. According to Dr.
Morton, for example, the mean internal capacity of the English
head is 96 cubic inches, while that of the Anglo-American is
only 90 cubic inches. Such a conclusion, if established as the
result of comparison of a sufficiently large number of well-authenticated
skulls, would be of great importance in its bearing on the
influence of change of climate, diet, habits, etc., as elements
affecting varieties of the human race. But determined as it
was in the Morton collection, from five English and seven
Anglo-American specimens, it can be regarded as little more
than a mere chance result. Ranged nearly in the order of
mean internal capacity of skull, the following are the results
arrived at, mainly by gauging the skulls in various collections
available for such comparisons of different races of mankind.
In presenting them here, I avail myself of Dr. Thurnam’s
researches, augmenting them with other data subsequently
published, including results deduced from Dr. Davis’s minute
reports of his own extensive collections, and taking Tiedemann’s
capacity of 92.3 for the European skull as 100.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tables of Dr. Morton and Dr. Davis furnish materials
for drawing comparisons between diverse nations of the great
European family; but though they are of value as contributions
to the required means for ethnical comparison, they fall
far short of determining the average cranial capacity of the
different nationalities. Whilst, for example, the tabular data
in the <span class='it'>Thesaurus Craniorum</span> show a mean internal capacity
of 94 cubic inches for the combined Teutonic family, the
Finns yield the higher mean capacity of 96.3 cubic
inches. Again, Dr. Thurnam found that the results
of the weighing of fifty-nine brains of patients at the Friends’
Retreat near York, mostly persons of the middle class of
society, yielded weights considerably above those which he
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>
subsequently obtained from testing those of pauper patients in
Wilts and Somerset. But this has to be estimated along with
the undoubted ethnical differences which separate the population
of Yorkshire from that of Somerset and Wiltshire. An
interesting paper in the West-Riding Asylum Reports gives
the results of the determination of 716 brain-weights, rather
more than half being males. The average is 48.149 oz. for
the male, and 43.872 for the female brain; whereas the
average weights of 267 male brains of a similar class of
patients in the Wilts County Asylum, as given by Dr.
Thurnam, is 46.2 oz., and of 213 female brains, 41.0 oz. The
results of the observations carried on by Dr. Boyd at St.
Marylebone yield, from 680 male English brains, a mean
weight of 47.1 oz., and from 744 female brains a mean
weight of 42.3 oz.; whereas Dr. Peacock determined, from
183 cases in the Edinburgh Infirmary, the weight of the male
Scottish brain to average 49.7, and that of the female brain to
average 44.3 oz. Here the results are determined by so
numerous a series that they might be accepted as altogether
reliable, were it not that in the former case they are based to
a large extent on a purely pauper class; whereas the patients
of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh include respectable
mechanics and others from many parts of Scotland, among
whom education is common. It is not to be doubted, indeed,
that a considerable difference in the form and size of the head,
and no doubt also in brain-weight, is to be looked for amongst
English, Scotch, Irish, German and French men and women,
according to the county or province of which they are natives,
and the class of society to which they belong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The comparative ratio of the cubical capacity of the skull,
or the average brain-weight, in so far as either is indicative of
ethnical differences among members of the European family of
nations, has thus to be determined by numerous examples; or
dealt with in detail in reference to the different nationalities.
Even in single provinces or counties, social position, and
probably education, must be taken into account; so that a
series of observations on hospital and pauper patients may be
expected to fall below the general average; and fallacious
comparisons between European peoples may be based on data,
correct enough <span class='it'>per se</span>, but unjust when placed alongside of a
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span>
different class of results. The great mass of evidence in reference
to brain-weight has thus far been mainly derived, in the
case of the sane, from one rank of life. A comparison of the
results with those derived from the insane of various classes of
society shows less discrepancy than might have been anticipated.
But there are certain cases of hydrocephalous and
other abnormally enlarged brains which have to be rigorously
excluded from any estimate of the size or weight of the brain,
either as a race-test or as an index of comparative mental power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Were it possible to select from among the great intellects
of all ages an adequate series of representative men, and
ascertain their brain-weights, or even the cubical capacity of
their skulls, one important step would be gained towards the
determination of the relation between size of brain and power
of intellect. But we have little other data than such hints as
the busts of Æschylus, Pericles, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and
other leaders of thought may supply. Malcolm Canmore—Malcolm
of the great head, as his name implied,—stands forth
with marked individuality from out the shadowy roll of names
which figure in early Scottish history. Charlemagne, we
should fancy, merited a similar designation. But the portraits
of his modern imperial successor, Charles V., show no such
loftiness of forehead. Judging from the portraits and busts of
Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Cromwell, Napoleon, and Scott,
their brains must have considerably exceeded the ordinary size.
In the report of the <span class='it'>post-mortem</span> examination of Scott, the
physicians state that “the brain was not large.” But this, no
doubt, means relatively to the internal capacity of the skull in
its then diseased condition. The intermastoid arch, as already
noted, shows a remarkably exceptional magnitude of 19 inches,
whereas the average of fifty-eight ancient and modern European
skulls, as given in the <span class='it'>Thesaurus Craniorum</span>, is only 14.60.
The portraits of Wordsworth and Byron show an ample forehead;
and the popular recognition of the “fair large front” of
Milton’s typical man as the index of superior intellect is an
induction universally accepted. But, on the other hand,
examples of intellectual greatness undoubtedly occur with the
brain little, if at all, in excess of the average size. On the
discovery of Dante’s remains at Ravenna in 1865, the skull
was pronounced to be ample, and exquisite in form. But its
<span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span>
actual cubical capacity and estimated brain-weight fall considerably
below those of the highest ascertained brain-weights
of distinguished men. Again, looking at the casts of the skulls
of Robert the Bruce and the poet Burns, the first impression is
the comparatively small size of head, and the moderate frontal
development in each. Robert Liston, the eminent surgeon,
remarked of the former: “The division of the cranium behind
the meatus auditorius is large in proportion to that situated
before it. The skull is also remarkably wide and capacious in
that part, whereas the forehead is rather depressed”;<a id='r168'/><a href='#f168' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[168]</span></sup></a> and
more recent observers have not hesitated to recognise in it a
reversion to the Canstadt type of the primitive European
savage. Other characteristics so markedly indicate the elements
of physical rather than intellectual vigour, that Liston
expressly pointed out the analogy to “the heads of carnivorous
animals.” The Bruce was indeed pre-eminently distinguished
for courage and deeds of personal prowess; but it was no less
by statesmanlike qualities, calm, resolute perseverance, and
wise prudence, that he achieved the independence of his
country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George Combe, the phrenologist, to whom the original cast
of Burns’s skull was first submitted, thus states the case in
reference to the frontal development of the poet: “An unskilful
observer looking at the forehead might suppose it to be
moderate in size; but when the dimensions of the anterior
lobe, in both length and breadth, are attended to, the intellectual
organs will be recognised to have been large. The
anterior lobe projects so much that it gives an appearance of
narrowness to the forehead which is not real.”<a id='r169'/><a href='#f169' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[169]</span></sup></a> The actual
dimensions of the skull are, longitudinal diameter, 8 inches;
parietal diameter, 5.95; and horizontal circumference, 22.25.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the year 1865 the bones of Italy’s greatest poet, Dante,
were submitted to a minute examination under the direction
of commissioners appointed by the Italian Government to
verify the discovery; and careful measurements were taken
of the skull. Dr. H. C. Barlow, describing it from personal
observation, says: “The head was finely formed, and the
cranium showed, by its ample and exquisite form, that it had
<span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span>
held the brain of no ordinary man. It was the most intellectually
developed head that I ever remember to have seen.
The occipital region was prominently marked, but the frontal
was also amply and broadly expanded, and the anterior part
of the frontal bone had a vertical direction in relation to the
bones of the face” (<span class='it'>Athenæum</span>, September 9, 1865). But
however intellectually developed and exquisite in form the
poet’s skull may have appeared, the actual measurements fall
short of the amplitude here assigned to it. The dimensions
are as follows: Internal capacity, determined by filling the
calvarium with grains of rice, 3.1321 lbs. av., or a little
over 50 oz.; circumference, 52 cent. 5 mill.; occipito-frontal
diameter, 31 cent. 7 mill.; transverse diameter, taken between
the ears, 31 cent. 8 mill.; height, 14 cent. If the internal
capacity is accepted without any correction, it would yield
57 oz., but if allowance be made, as in the actual weighing of
the brain, for the abstraction of the dura mater and fluids, of
say 8 per cent, this would reduce it to about 52.5, or nearly
the same weight as that of the mathematician, Gauss. Professor
Welcker deducts from 11.6 to 14 per cent, according
to the size of the skull; Dr. J. B. Davis recommends a uniform
deduction of 10 per cent. If we apply the latter rule, it will
reduce the estimated weight of Dante’s brain to 51.3 oz.<a id='r170'/><a href='#f170' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[170]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Another interesting example of the skull of an Italian poet
is that of Ugo Foscolo, a cast of which was taken on the
transfer of his remains to the Church of Santa Croce at
Florence. Though only fifty years old at the time of his
death, the skull was marked by “the entire ossification of the
coronal, sagittal, and lambdoidal sutures, and that atrophy of
the outer table, manifested by a depression on each side in the
posterior half of each parietal, leaving an elevated ridge in the
<span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span>
middle, in the position of the sagittal, which is but rarely
observed except in extremely advanced age.”<a id='r171'/><a href='#f171' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[171]</span></sup></a> Sir Henry
Holland, who knew the poet intimately, describes him as resembling
in temperament the painter Fuseli, “passionately eccentric
in social life.” Full of genius and original thought, as the
writings of Foscolo show him to have been, he “was fiery and
impulsive, almost to the verge of madness.”<a id='r172'/><a href='#f172' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[172]</span></sup></a> He died in
England in obscurity and neglect; but a regenerated Italy
recalled the memory of her lost poet, and transferred his
remains to Santa Croce’s consecrated soil. The estimated size
of his brain is given as 1426 cubic cents., equivalent to 87
cubic inches internal capacity, which corresponds to a weight of
brain of 48.44 oz. The longitudinal diameter is 6.90; the
parietal diameter 5.70; the intermastoid arch 15.0; and the
horizontal circumference 520 mm., or 20.5 inches. The brain
capacity of the poet was thus little more than the European
mean deduced by Morton from the miscellaneous examples in
his collection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. J. C. Gustav Lucae, in his <span class='it'>Zur Organischen Formenlehre</span>,
furnishes views and measurements of two other skulls of men
of known intellectual capacity. One of these is Johan Jacob
Wilhelm Heinse, the author of <span class='it'>Ardinghello</span>, a work of high
character in the elements of æsthetic criticism, though as a
romance fit to rank with <span class='it'>Don Juan</span> in subjective significance
and morality. He wrote another romance entitled <span class='it'>Hildegard</span>;
in addition to numerous articles and translations of Petronius,
Tasso, etc., which won for him the high commendation of
Goethe, and the more guarded admiration of Wieland. His
skull, as figured by Dr. Lucae, shows the frontal suture still
open at the age of fifty-three, at which he died. The internal
capacity of the skull is stated as 41.4 oz., equivalent to 1173
grms. In this, as in other examples hereafter referred to,
Dr. Lucae has gauged the capacity of the skull with peas, and
gives the weight in “unzen.” In the results deduced from
them here the <span class='it'>unzen</span> are assumed to be Prussian ounces, the
lb. of 12 oz. equal to 350.78348 grms. As already noted,
the determination of the internal capacity of the skull by
varying tests, such as pease, rice, and sands of diverse degrees
<span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span>
of fineness, leads to uncertain results. In those here deduced
from the data furnished by Dr. Lucae, the unzen have been
tested by a series of experiments made with a view to correct
the error necessarily resulting from the fact that peas do not
entirely fill the cavity. The results show that 82.5 grms. of
ordinary sized peas occupy the space of 100 grms. of water.
Deducting 10 per cent for membranes and fluids, the estimated
brain-weight of Heinse is 1379 grms. or 48.7 oz. av.

more strongly defined at the age of sixty than in that of Heinse.
The internal capacity of the skull is stated as 42.8 oz., equivalent
to 1213 grms., which, dealt with as above stated, yields
1410 grms. or 49.8 oz. av. Other dimensions of the skull are
given as follows:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The premature ossification of the sagittal suture, by arresting
the expansion of the brain laterally, is a frequent source
of abnormal elongation of the head. On the other hand the
frontal suture, which ordinarily closes in the man-child before
birth, though persistent in the lower animals, is occasionally
found to remain open in man till maturity, as in the two
notable cases here described. Darwin refers to it as a case of
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span>
arrested development. “This suture,” he says, “occasionally
persists, more or less distinctly, in man after maturity, and
more frequently in ancient than in recent crania; especially,
as Canestrini has observed, in those exhumed from the Drift,
and belonging to the brachycephalic type. In this and other
instances the cause of ancient races approaching the lower
animals in certain characters more frequently than do the
modern races, appears to be that the latter stand at a somewhat
greater distance in the long line of descent from their
early semi-human progenitors.”<a id='r173'/><a href='#f173' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[173]</span></sup></a> It may be permissible to
express a doubt as to this relative frequency of the occurrence
of the frontal suture in ancient and modern races, since the
great naturalist does not state it as a result of his own observations.
Not only am I led to do so from repeatedly noting its
occurrence in modern crania; but its effect can in no way
favour arrested development. It must rather admit of the
free expansion of the frontal lobes of the brain, the decrease
of which in a progressive ratio is characteristic of the orang,
chimpanzee, and baboon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the general question of cranial development as an index
of cerebral capacity, Professor Welcker assigns a standard,
which was accepted by Dr. Thurnam, thus: “Skulls of more
than 540 to 550 millimetres in horizontal circumference (the
weight of brain belonging to which is 1490 to 1560 grms.,
or 52.5-55 oz. av.), are to be regarded as exceptionally
large. The designation of <span class='it'>kephalones</span>, proposed by Virchow,
might commence from this point. Men with great mental
endowments fall, for the most part, under the definition of
kephalony. If we consider the relations of capacity, 1800
grms. (63.5 oz.) appears to be the greatest attainable weight
of brain within a skull not pathologically enlarged.” But the
brain of Cuvier—the heaviest healthy brain yet recorded,—exceeded
this. Its weight is stated by Wagner as 1861
grms., or 65.8 oz.; but this M. Broca corrects to 1829.96
grms. Even thus reduced it exceeds the limits assigned by
Professor Welcker to the normal healthy brain. But a curious
commentary upon this is furnished by the fact that the modern
English skull which Dr. Davis selects as presenting the most
striking analogy to the Neanderthal skull—“the most ape-like
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>
skull which Professor Huxley had ever beheld,”—though
marked not only by the prominence of the superciliary ridges,
but by great depression of the frontal region, appears to have
a cubical capacity equivalent to that of Dr. Abercrombie,
whose brain is only surpassed by that of Cuvier among the
ascertained brain-weights of distinguished men.<a id='r174'/><a href='#f174' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[174]</span></sup></a> Its capacity
is 94 oz. of sand, or 113 cubic inches, equivalent—after
making the requisite deduction for membranes and fluids,—to
a brain-weight of 63 oz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have attempted in the following table to reduce to some
common standard such imperfect glimpses as are recoverable
of the cranial capacity of some distinguished men, of whose
actual brain-weights no record exists:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the examples adduced in the above table appear
to exhibit instances of mental endowment of high character,
without the corresponding degree of cranial, and consequently
cerebral development. The following table exhibits recorded
examples of a series of actual brain-weights of distinguished
men. It seems to lend confirmation to the idea that great
manifestation of mental endowment is correlated, in the
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span>
majority of observed cases, to a brain above the normal
average in mass or weight. But even here intellect and
brain-weight are not strictly in uniform ratio. Several of the
following brain-weights, including that of Tiedemann, are
furnished by Wagner, in the <span class='it'>Vorstudien des Menschlichen
Gehirns</span>; but in an elaborate table of brain-weights given
in the <span class='it'>Morphologie und physiologie des Menschlichen gehirns als
Seelenorgan</span>, the brain of Byron is classed above all except
Cuvier; while Vogt gives the same place, by estimate, to
Schiller’s, as next in rank to that of the great naturalist
among highly developed brains. Dr. Thurnam states his
authorities for others, when producing them in his valuable
contribution to the <span class='it'>Journal of Mental Science</span> “On the Weight
of the Brain.” For that of Webster he refers to “the unsatisfactory
article on the brain of Daniel Webster, <span class='it'>Edin. Med. Surg.
Journ.</span>, vol. lxxix. p. 355.” Dr. J. C. Nott, in his “Comparative
Anatomy of Races” (<span class='it'>Types of Mankind</span>, p. 453), says:
“Dr. Wyman, in his <span class='it'>post-mortem</span> examination of the famed
Daniel Webster, found the internal capacity of the cranium
to be 122 cubic inches, and in a private letter to me, he says:
‘The circumference was measured outside of the integuments
before the scalp was removed, and may, perhaps, as there was
much emaciation, be a little less than in health.’ It was 23¾
inches in circumference; and the Doctor states that it is well
known there are several heads in Boston larger than Webster’s.
I have myself, in the last few weeks, measured half a dozen
heads as large and larger.” The circumference, it will be seen,
exceeds the corresponding measurement of Scott’s head, taken
under similar circumstances. But the statement of 122 cubic
inches as the internal capacity of Webster’s skull seems open
to question. If correct, instead of 53.5 oz. of brain-weight
as stated in the following table, it is the equivalent of a brain-weight
of fully 65 oz., or one in excess even of that, of Cuvier.
The brain-weights of Goodsir, Simpson, and Agassiz, are given
in the following table from the reported autopsy in each
case:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Thurnam, in producing fifteen of the above examples,
remarks: “Altogether, they decidedly confirm the generally
received view of the connection between size of brain and
mental power and intelligence”; and he adds his conviction
that if the examination of the brain in the upper ranks of
society, and in men whose mental endowments are well known,
were more generally available, further confirmation would be
given to this conclusion. The converse, at least, is certain,
that no great intelligence or unwonted mental power is possible
with a brain much below the average in mass and weight
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span>
But while the above list exhibits a series of exceptionally
high brain-weights of distinguished men, the relative weights
in some cases—as in Napoleon—are calculated to excite
surprise if viewed as an index of comparative intellectual
capacity. On the other hand, those lowest in the scale,
and below the mean weight, include men of undoubted
eminence in letters and science; while the proofs are no less
unquestionable that a large healthy brain is not invariably the
organ of unwonted intelligence or mental activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the <span class='it'>Philosophical Transactions</span> of 1861, Dr. Boyd published
an elaborate series of researches illustrative of the
weight of various organs of the human body, including the
weights of two thousand brains. Most of the healthy brains
are those of patients in the St. Marylebone Infirmary, and
have already been referred to as necessarily representing the
indigent and uneducated classes of London. Here, therefore,
if an unusually large brain is the index of intellectual power,
every probability was against the occurrence of brains above
the average size or weight. But the results by no means
confirm this assumption. Among the patients in the Edinburgh
Royal Infirmary, in like manner, though including the
better class of artizans and others from country districts, we
might still look for a confirmation of M. Broca’s assumption,
based on extensive observations of French crania, “that, other
things being equal, whether as the result of education, or by
hereditary transmission, the volume of the skull, and consequently
of the brain, is greater in the higher than in the lower
classes.” But Dr. Peacock’s tables include four brain-weights,
three of them of a sailor, a printer, and a tailor, respectively,
ranging from 61 to 62.75 oz.; and so surpassing all but two,
or at the most three, of the heaviest ascertained brain-weights
of distinguished men. Tried by the posthumous test of internal
capacity, three skulls of nameless Frenchmen, derived from the
common cemeteries of Paris, in like manner showed brains
equalling in size that of Cuvier. The following are the
maximum brain-weights among the St. Marylebone patients
apparently unaffected by cerebral disease:—

<p class='pindent'>The stature, or relative size of body, has already been referred
to as an element in testing the comparative male and
female weight of brain; and it is one which ought not to be
overlooked in estimating the comparative size and weight of
the brains of distinguished men. From my own recollections
of Dr. Chalmers, who was of moderate stature, his head appeared
proportionally large. The same was noticeable in the
cases of Lord Jeffrey, Lord Macaulay, Sir James Y. Simpson,
and very markedly so in that of De Quincey. The philosopher
Kant was also of small stature; and Dr. Thurnam refers to the
observation of Carus that he had a head not absolutely large,
though, in proportion to the small and puny body of that
eminent thinker, it was of remarkable size. Among the large-brained
artizans of the Marylebone Infirmary, on the contrary,
the probabilities are in favour of a majority of them being men
of full muscular development and ample stature. Nevertheless,
with every allowance for this, it still remains probable, if
not demonstrable, that from the same humble and unnoted
class, examples of megalocephaly could be selected little short
in cerebral mass, and apparently in brain-weight, of the group
of men whose large brains are recognised as the concomitants
<span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span>
of exceptionally great mental capacity and intellectual vigour.
Unless, therefore, we are contented to accept the poet’s dictum,
“Their lot forbad,”<a id='r175'/><a href='#f175' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[175]</span></sup></a> and assume that “chill penury repressed
their noble rage, and froze the genial current of the soul,” it is
manifest that other elements besides those of volume or
weight are essential as cerebral indices of mental power. Dr.
Thurnam, after noting examples that had come under his own
notice of brain-weights above the medium—but which, as those
of insane patients, may be assigned to other causes than healthy
cerebral development,—adds: “The heaviest brain weighed
by me (62 oz., or 1760 grms.) was that of an uneducated
butcher, who was just able to read, and who died suddenly of
epilepsy, combined with mania, after about a year’s illness.
The head was large, but well-formed; the brain of normal consistence;
the <span class='it'>puncta vasculosa</span> numerous.” In cases like this,
of weighty brain with no corresponding manifestation of intellectual
power, something else was wanting besides an ampler
sphere. The mere position of a humble artizan or labourer
will not suffice to mar the capacity to “make by force his
merit known,” which pertains to the “divinely gifted man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arkwright, Franklin, Watt, Stephenson, Farraday, Hugh Miller,
and others of the like type of self-made men, are not rare.
Among the large-brained artizans, scarcely one can have had a
more limited sphere for the exercise of mental vigour than the
poet Burns, the child of poverty and toil, who refers to his own
early years as passed in “the unceasing moil of a galley-slave.”
In his case the very means essential to a healthy physical
development were stinted at the most critical period of life.
His brother Gilbert says: “We lived sparingly. For several
years butcher’s meat was a stranger to the house; while all
exerted themselves to the utmost of their strength, and rather
beyond it, in the labours of the farm. My brother, at the age
of thirteen, assisted in thrashing the crop of corn, and at fifteen
was the principal labourer on the farm.” Such premature toil
and privations left their permanent stamp on his frame. “Externally,
the consequences appeared in a stoop of the shoulders,
which never left him; but internally, in the more serious form
of mental depression, attended by a nervous disorder which
affected the movements of the heart.” He had only exchanged
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span>
the toil on his father’s farm for equally unremitting labour on
his own, when the finest of his poems were written; nor would
it be inconsistent with all the facts to assume that the privations
of his early life diminished his capacity for continuous
mental activity; as it undoubtedly impaired his physical constitution.
But, while the possession of a brain much above
the average in size might have seemed to account for his
triumph over the depressing influences of his limited sphere,
the fact that his brain appears to have been below the average
size, points to some other requisite than mere cerebral mass as
essential to intellectual vigour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brain is influenced in all its functions by the character
and the amount of blood circulating through it, and promptly
manifests the effects of any deleterious substance, such as
alcohol or opium, introduced into its tissues. It depends, like
other portions of the nervous system, on an adequate supply of
nourishment. In both respects the brain of the Ayrshire poet
was injuriously affected, in so far as we may infer from all the
known circumstances of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The human brain is large in proportion to the body in
infancy and youth; and the opinions of leading anatomists and
physiologists early in the present century favoured the idea
that it attained its full size within a few years after birth.
Professor Sœmmering assumed this to take place so early as
the third year. Sir William Hamilton explicitly stated his
conclusion thus: “In man the encephalon reaches its full
size about seven years of age”; and Tiedemann assigns the
eighth year as that in which it attains its greatest development.
But the more accurate and extended observations since carried
on rather tend to the conclusion that the brain not only goes
on increasing in size and weight to a much later period of life;
but that it is healthfully stimulated by habitual activity, and
under exceptionally favouring circumstances it may increase in
weight long after the body has attained its maximum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The largest average brain-weights, as determined by observations
on the brains of upwards of 2000 men and women in
different countries of Europe, have indeed been found in those not
above twenty years of age; and from a nearly equal number of
English examples, Dr. Boyd determines the period of greatest
average weight to be the interval between fourteen and twenty
<span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span>
years of age; but this includes cases in which death has ensued
from undue or premature brain development.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other evidence leaves no room for doubt that cases are
not rare of the growth, or increased density of the brain up to
middle age; while the observations of Professor Welcker indicate
this process extended to a later period of life. The average
brain-weights, as given by Boyd, Peacock, and Broca, from
healthy or sane cases, along with those of Welcker, include the
weights of 47 male brains from ten to twenty years of age,
giving an average of 49.6 oz., or 1405 grms.; and of 112
male brains from twenty to thirty years of age, giving an average
of 48.9 oz., or 1384 grms.; and the results of a nearly
equal number of female brains closely approximate. They
embrace English, Scotch, German, and French, men and women.
Dr. Welcker’s results indicate the period of maximum brain-weight
to be between 30-40, as shown in the following table:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the female examples, amounting to thirty-one between
seventy and eighty years of age, and six between eighty and
ninety, the continuous diminution of brain-weight corresponds
with the increasing age; but in the male examples, sixty-five
cases between sixty and seventy years of age yield an average
brain-weight of 46.1 oz., while twenty-seven cases between
seventy and eighty years of age give 47.9 as the average;
falling in the next decade to 43.8.
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be inferred from the number of cases pointing to an
early attainment of the highest average brain-weight, not that
the brain differs from all other internal organs of the human
body in attaining its maximum before the period of puberty;
but that physical as well as mental vigour are dependent on
the maintenance of a nice equilibrium between the brain and
the other organs while in process of development. The observations
of Dr. Boyd, including the results of 2614 <span class='it'>post-mortem</span>
examinations of sane and insane patients of all ages, showed
that the average weight of the brain of “still-born” children
at the full period was much greater than that of the new-born
living child. It is a legitimate inference, therefore, that death
in the former cases was traceable to an excessive premature
development of the brain. Again, when it is shown from
numerous cases that the highest average weights of brain in
both sexes occur not later than twenty years of age, it appears
a more legitimate inference to trace to exceptional cerebral
development towards the period of adolescence, the mortality
which rendered available so many examples of unusually large
or heavy brains, than to assume that the normal healthy brain
begins to diminish at that age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a fact familiar to popular observation that a large
head in youth is apt to be unfavourable to life. A tendency
to epilepsy appears to be the frequent concomitant of an
unusually large brain; and with the congestion accompanying
its abnormal condition, this may account for the weights of
such diseased brains as have been repeatedly found in excess
of nearly all the recorded examples of megalocephaly in the
cases of distinguished men. But a greater interest attaches to
a remarkable example of healthy megalocephaly recorded in
the <span class='it'>British Medical Journal</span> for 1872. The case was that of
a boy thirteen years of age, who died in Middlesex Hospital
from injuries caused by a fall from an omnibus. His brain
was found to weigh 58 oz. He had been a particularly
healthy lad, without any evidence of rachitis, and very intelligent.
This is a strikingly exceptional case of a healthy brain,
at the age of thirteen, exceeding in weight all but two of the
greatest ascertained brain-weights of distinguished men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the evidence already adduced of relative cubical
capacity of the skulls of different races, it appears, as was to
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span>
be expected, that there is a greater prevalence of the amply-developed
brain among the higher and more civilised races.
But all averages are apt to be deceptive; and the progressive
scale from the smallest up to the greatest mass of brain is by
no means in the precise ratio of an intellectual scale of progression.
The results of Dr. J. B. Davis’s investigations, based
on the study of a large, and in many cases a seemingly
adequate number of skulls, bring out this remarkable fact, that,
so far from the Polynesians occupying a rank in the lowest
scale, as affirmed by Professor Vogt, the Oceanic races of the
Pacific generally rank in internal capacity of skull, and consequent
size of brain, next to the European.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is of more importance for our present inquiry to
note that, as exceptionally large and heavy brains occur among
the most civilised races, in some cases—and in some only—accompanied
with corresponding manifestations of unusual
intellectual power; so also it becomes apparent that skulls
much exceeding the average, and some of remarkable internal
capacity, are met with among barbarian races, and even among
some of the lowest savages. Taking the crania in the elaborate
series of tables in Dr. J. B. Davis’s <span class='it'>Thesaurus Craniorum</span>,
with an internal capacity above 100 cubic inches, they will
rank in order as follows:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the European series the largest is an Irish cranium
of 121.6 cubic inches, and next to it comes an Italian, 114.3,
and an Englishman, 112.4; an ancient Briton from a Yorkshire
Long Barrow, 109.4; an ancient Roman, 106.4; a

Lapp, 105.8; an ancient Gaul, 103.7; a Briton of Roman
times, 103.3; a Merovingian Frank, 101.5; and an Anglo-Saxon,
100.9. Those and other examples of the like kind are
full of interest as showing the recurrence of megalocephalic
variations from the common cranial and cerebral standard
among ancient races; and among rudest savages as well as
among the most cultivated classes of modern civilised nations.

<p class='pindent'>Opportunities for testing the size and weight of the brain
among barbarous races are only rarely accessible to those who
are qualified to avail themselves of them for the purposes of
science. Some near approximation to the relative brain-weight
of the English, Scotch, German, and French, may now
be assumed to have been established. Dr. Thurnam instituted
a comparison between those and two of the prehistoric races of
Britain—the Dolichocephali of the Long Barrows, and the
Brachycephali of the Round Barrows of England.<a id='r176'/><a href='#f176' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[176]</span></sup></a> The results

<p class='pindent'>The highest average of any nationality, as determined by
Drs. Reid and Peacock from the weighing of 157 brains of
male patients, chiefly Scottish Lowlanders, in the Royal Infirmary
of Edinburgh, is little more than 50 oz., or 1417
grammes; whereas the estimated average brain-weight in the
ancient British skulls is 54 oz. for the Dolichocephali of the
Long Barrows, which equals that of Sir James Simpson, and
exceeds all but six of the most distinguished men adduced in
<a href='#table4'>Table IV.</a> For the Brachycephali of the Round Barrows it is
53.5 oz., which is in excess of the brain-weights of Agassiz,
Chalmers, Whewell, and other distinguished men, and exactly
accords with that of Daniel Webster and Lord Chancellor
Campbell. In so far, moreover, as this illustrates the cerebral
capacity of ancient races, it is in each case an average obtained
by gauging eighteen skulls, and not the cranial capacity of one
or two exceptionally large ones. Dr. Thurnam does indeed
suggest that the Barrows may have been the sepulchres of
chiefs; nor is this unlikely; but the superior vigour and
mental endowment which this implies fails to account for a
cerebral capacity surpassing all but the most distinguished men
of science and letters in modern Europe referred to in the
above table. Rather may we conclude from this, as from
other evidence, that quality of brain may, within certain limits,
be of more significance than mere quantity; and that brains
of the same volume, and agreeing in weight, may greatly
differ in minute structure and in powers of cerebration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of the ancient British Barrow-Builders we seem
to have large heads and remarkable development of brain,
without any indications of an equivalent in intellectual power;
and although the estimated brain-weight derived from gauging
the capacity of the empty chamber of the skull proceeds on
the assumption of mass and weight agreeing, sufficient data
exist to justify the adoption of this for approximate results.
The average weight of brain of twelve male Negroes of undetermined
tribes, deduced from gauging their skulls, has been
ascertained to amount to 1255 grammes, or 44.3 oz. The
actual weight of brain of the Negro of Guinea, described by
Professor Calori, was 1260 grammes; and other examples vary
considerably from the average. Mascagni gives 1458 grammes
as the weight of one Negro brain weighed by him; equivalent
<span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>
to an actual brain-weight of 51.5 oz., which is greater than
that of Dupuytren, Whewell, Hermann, Tiedemann, or Grote.
Nevertheless, although the extremes are great, and are confirmed
by a like diversity in measurements of the horizontal
circumference and of internal capacity, the average result given
above appears to be a fair and reliable one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus far the inquiry into data illustrative of comparative
size and weight of brain has dealt chiefly with the races of
the eastern hemisphere. The compass is great in point of
time in so far as it embraces savage and civilised peoples,
including the barbarians of Europe’s Palæolithic era, along with
modern tribes of Asia, Africa, and Australia, and some of the
most notable among the prehistoric races of the British Isles.
The compass is equally great in the range of intellectual
development, when to those are added data illustrative of the
average brain-weight of some of the leading nations of modern
Europe, and a series of examples derived from noted instances
of the highest exceptional types of intellectual power and
activity in recent times. Some general conclusions of a comprehensive
kind seem to follow legitimately from this evidence.
Notwithstanding the prominence given to the assumed evidence
of a low type of skull, depressed forehead, and poor frontal
development, in the assumed primitive European Canstadt
race, when we keep in view the enormous interval of time
assumed to separate “those savages who peopled Europe in the
Palæolithic age” from our own era, the amount of difference
in size and apparent brain-weight is not remarkable. Compared
with those of contemporary savage races it suggests no
more than the accompanying development of the brain in a
ratio with the intellectual activities of progressive civilisation,
and even then the relative brain-mass of the lowest type is
suggestive of latent powers only needing development. But
the old and later races of the New World stand in a different
relation to each other; and the process thus far employed
when applied to determine the comparative cranial capacities
of the native American races, discloses results of a different
character, and widely at variance with those above described
relating to the ancient races of Britain. On the continent of
America the native ethnical scale embraces a comparatively
narrow range, and any intrusive elements are sufficiently
<span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span>
recent to be easily eliminated. The Patagonian and the
Fuegian rank alongside of the Bushman, the Andaman Islander,
or the Australian, as among the lowest types of humanity;
while the Aztecs, Mayas, Quichuas, and Aymaras, attained to
the highest scale which has been reached independently by
any native American race. We owe to the zealous and indefatigable
labours of Dr. Morton, alike in the formation of his
great collection of human crania, and in the published results
embodied in the <span class='it'>Crania Americana</span>, a large amount of
knowledge derived from this class of evidence in reference to
the races of the New World. In one respect, at least, those
results stand out in striking contrast to the large-headed
barbarian Barrow-Builders of ancient Britain. Dr. Morton
subdivides the American races into the Toltecan race, embracing
the semi-civilised communities of Mexico, Bogota, and
Peru, and the barbarous tribes scattered over the continent
from the Arctic circle to Tierra del Fuego. His latest views
are embodied in a contribution to Schoolcraft’s <span class='it'>History of
the Indian Tribes of the United States</span>, entitled “The Physical
Type of the American Indians.” In treating of the volume of
brain, he draws special attention to the Peruvian skulls, 201
in number, obtained for him from the cemeteries of Pisco,
Pachacamac, and Arica. “Herera informs us that Pachacamac
was sacred to priests, nobles, and other persons of distinction;
and there is ample evidence that Arica and Pisco, though free
to all classes, were among the most favoured cemeteries of
Peru.” Dr. Morton accordingly adds: “It is of some importance
to the present inquiry, that nearly one-half of this series
of Peruvian crania was obtained at Pachacamac; whence the
inference that they belonged to the most intellectual and cultivated
portion of the Peruvian nation; for in Peru learning of
every kind was an exclusive privilege of the ruling caste.” In
reality, however, later additions to our knowledge of the
physical characteristics of the ancient Peruvians tend to confirm
the idea of the existence of two distinct races: a patrician
order occupying a position analogous to the Franks of Gaul or
the Normans of England, though more aptly to be compared
to the Brahmins of India; and a more numerous class, constituting
the labouring and industrial orders of the community,
abundantly represented in the Pacific coast tribes of Peru, the
<span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span>
cemeteries of which have furnished the larger number of crania
to European and American collections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To such a patrician order or caste the intellectual superiority
and privileges of the governing race pertained. But whatever
may have been the exclusive prerogatives of the patrician
and sacerdotal orders, there is no doubt that the Peruvians as
a people had carried metallurgy to as high a development as
has been attained by any race ignorant of working in iron.
They had acquired great skill in the arts of the goldsmith, the
engraver, chaser, and modeller. Pottery was fashioned into
many artistic and fanciful forms, showing ingenuity and great
versatility of fancy. They excelled as engineers, architects,
sculptors, weavers, and agriculturists. Their public works
display great skill, combined with comprehensive aims of
practical utility; and alone, among all the nations of the New
World, they had domesticated animals, and trained them as
beasts of burden. It is not, therefore, without reason that
Dr. Morton adds: “When we consider the institutions of the
old Peruvians, their comparatively advanced civilisation, their
tombs and temples, mountain roads and monolithic gateways,
together with their knowledge of certain ornamental arts, it is
surprising to find that they possessed a brain no larger than
the Hottentot and New Hollander, and far below that of the
barbarous hordes of their own race. For, on measuring 155
crania, nearly all derived from the sepulchres just mentioned,
they give but 75 cubic inches (equivalent, after due deduction
for membranes and fluids, to a brain of 40.1 oz. av. in weight,)
for the average bulk of the brain. Of the whole number, only
one attains the capacity of 101 cubic inches, and the minimum
sinks to 58, the smallest in the whole series of 641 measured
crania. It is important further to remark that the sexes are
nearly equally represented, namely, eighty men and seventy-five
women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other collections subsequently formed have largely added
to our means of testing the curious question thus raised of the
apparent inverse ratio of volume of brain to intellectual power
and progressive civilisation among the native races of the
American continent. In 1866, Mr. E. G. Squier presented to
the Peabody Museum of American Archæology and Ethnology
at Harvard, a collection of seventy-five Peruvian skulls,
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span>
obtained by himself from various localities both on the coast
and in the interior. “The skulls from the interior represent
the Aymara on Lake Titicaca, as well as the Quichua, Cuzco,
or Inca families; and the skulls of every coast family from
Tumbes to Atacama, or from Ecuador to Chili.”<a id='r177'/><a href='#f177' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[177]</span></sup></a> Subsequently
the curator, the late Professor Jeffreys Wyman, made
this collection, along with two others, of skulls from the
mounds of Kentucky and Florida, the subject of careful comparative
measurements. The following are the results: The
crania from Florida were chiefly obtained from a burial place
near an ancient Indian shell mound of gigantic proportions, a
few miles distant from Cedar Keys. They are eighteen in
number, and have a mean capacity of 1375.7 cubic centimetres,
or nearly 84 cubic inches. The skulls from the
Kentucky mounds, twenty-four in number, show a mean
capacity of 1313 cubic centimetres, 80.21 cubic inches, with
a difference of 125 cubic centimetres, or 7.61 cubic inches in
favour of the males. Yet, small as the Kentucky skulls are,
they exceed the Peruvian ones. Keeping in view the varied
sources of the latter, Professor Wyman remarks: “Although
the crania from the several localities show some differences as
regards capacity, yet in most other respects they are alike.”
And the numbers, when viewed separately, are too few to
attach much importance to variations within so narrow a
range. Nevertheless it is noteworthy that the highest mean
is that of the Aymaras of Lake Titicaca; and this difference is
considerably increased by measurements derived from subsequent
additions to the Harvard collection, received since the
death of Professor Wyman from the high valley of Lake
Titicaca. In other respects besides their marked superiority
in size, the latter crania differ from those of the Coast tribes,
and confirm the earlier deduction of an ethnical distinction
between the more numerous race so abundantly represented in
the Coast cemeteries, and that which is chiefly represented by
crania brought from the interior. The numbers from the
several localities selected by Professor Wyman as fair average
specimens of the whole stand thus: six from burial towers, or
chulpas, near Lake Titicaca, 1292; five from Cajamaquilla,
1268.75; fourteen from Casma, 1254; four from Truxillo,
<span class='pageno' title='390' id='Page_390'></span>
1236; four from Pachicamac, 1195; sixteen from Amacavilca,
1176.2; and seven from Grand Chimu, 1094.28.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1872, the collection of Peruvian crania in the Peabody
Museum was augmented by a large addition from 330 skulls
obtained by Professor Agassiz, through the intervention of Mr.
T. J. Hutchinson, British Consul at Callao, in Peru. From
those contributed to the Harvard Museum, Dr. Wyman selected
eleven as apparently the only ones unaffected by any artificial
compression or distortion, and therefore valuable as illustrations
of the normal shape of the Peruvian head. They are quite
symmetrical. The occiput, instead of being flattened or
vertical, as in the distorted crania, has the ordinary curves, and
in some of them is prominent. Two of them are marked by a
low, retreating forehead; but in all the others the forehead is
moderately developed. As, moreover, the larger half appear to
be the skulls of females, this accounts for the mean capacity
falling below the Peruvian average. But they are all small.
The largest of them is only 1260 cubic centimetres, or less
than 74 cubic inches; and the average capacity of ten of them
is 1129 cubic centimetres, or 69 cubic inches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The collection, as a whole, differs from that of Mr. Squier,
in having been derived from the huacas, or ancient graves of
one locality, that of Ancon, near Callao. Professor Wyman
stated as the result of his careful study of them: “The average
capacity obtained from the whole collection, including those
having the distorted as well as the natural shape, varies but
little from that of previous measurements,” including those of
Morton and Meigs, and his own results from the Squier
collection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another collection of 150 ancient skulls, obtained by Mr.
Hutchinson during his residence in Peru, and presented to the
Anthropological Institute of London, has the additional value,
like that of Squier, of having been carefully selected from
different localities, including Santos, Ica, Ancon, Passamayo, and
Cerro del Oro; and the same may be said of those enumerated
in the <span class='it'>Thesaurus Craniorum</span> of Dr. Davis. We have thus
unusually ample materials for determining the cranial characteristics
of this remarkable people, and the results in every
case are the same. After a careful examination of the Peruvian
skulls, in the London anthropological collection, Professor Busk
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span>
states his conclusions thus: “The mean capacity of the larger
skulls, which may be regarded as males, appears, as far as I
have gone, to be about 80 cubic inches, equivalent to a brain
of about 45 ounces, roughly estimated. This capacity, and the
measurements above cited, show that the crania generally are
of small size”; and he adds: “this is in accord with the
statements of all observers.”<a id='r178'/><a href='#f178' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[178]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Davis has added to the valuable data included in his
<span class='it'>Thesaurus Craniorum</span>, a series of measurements of skeletons.
Unfortunately that of a male Quichua, procured by him in the
form of a “Peruvian mummy,” proved to be affected with
carious disease about the last dorsal and upper lumbar vertebræ;
and consequently the length of the vertebral column essential
for comparison with the skeletons of other races, is wanting;
but the other measurements indicate in this example a stature
below the average, while the skull exceeds it. The average
internal capacity of eighteen Quichua male skulls, as given by
Dr. Davis, is seventy-three, whereas this is 78.5. That the
ancient Peruvian skulls are, with rare exceptions, of small size,
is undoubted; and in view of this it becomes a matter of some
importance to determine whether this was in any degree due
to a correspondingly small stature. Obscure references are found
in the legendary history of Peru to a pigmy race. Pedro de
Cieza de Leon, whose travels have been translated by Mr.
Markham, refers to the first emigration of the Indians of
Chincha to that valley, “where they found many inhabitants,
but all of such small stature, that the tallest was barely two
cubits high” (p. 260). Garcilasso de la Vega repeats another
tradition heard by himself in Peru, of a race of giants who
came by sea to the country, and were so tall that the natives
reached no higher than their knees. They lived by rapine, and
wasted the whole country till they were destroyed by fire from
heaven. Traditions of this class may possibly point to the
existence of an aboriginal race of small stature. The aborigines
of Guatemala, Salvador, and Nicaragua, are described as below
the middle size (Bancroft, vol. i. p. 688); and Von Tchudi
divides the wild Indians of Peru into the Iscuchanos, the
natives of the highlands, a tall, slim, vigorous race, with the
head proportionally large and the forehead low; and those of
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span>
the hot lowlands, a smaller race, lank, but broad shouldered,
with a broad face and small round chin. There appear,
therefore, to be traces of one or more aboriginal races of small
stature. But Dr. Morton says expressly of the Peruvians: “Our
knowledge of their physical appearance is derived solely from
their tombs. In stature they appear not to have been in any
respect remarkable, nor to have differed from the cognate
nations except in the conformation of the head, which is small,
greatly elongated, narrow its whole length, with a very retreating
forehead, and possessing more symmetry than is usual in
skulls of the American race.” Some of the characteristics
here referred to are, in part at least, the result of artificial
modifications; but the small head appears to be an indisputable
characteristic of the most numerous ancient people of Peru.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may not unreasonably excite surprise that Dr. Morton
should have adduced results apparently pointing to the conclusion
that civilisation had progressed among the native races
of the American continent in an inverse ratio to the volume of
brain; and yet passed it over with such slight comment. The
only hint at a recognition of the difficulty is where, as he draws
his work to a close, he indicates his observation of a greater
anterior and coronal development in the smaller Peruvian brain.
“It is curious,” he says, “to observe that the barbarous nations
possess a larger brain by 5½ cubic inches than the Toltecans;
while, on the other hand, the Toltecans possess a greater relative
capacity of the anterior chamber of the skull in the proportion
of 42.3 to 41.8. Again, the coronal region, though
absolutely greater in the barbarous tribes, is rather larger in
proportion in the demi-civilised tribes.”<a id='r179'/><a href='#f179' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[179]</span></sup></a> But Dr. Morton
also noted that the heads of nine Peruvian children in his
possession “appear to be nearly if not quite as large as those
of children of other nations at the same age”;<a id='r180'/><a href='#f180' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[180]</span></sup></a> so that he
seemed to recognise something equivalent to an arrested
cerebral development accompanying the intellectual activity
of this remarkable people at some later stage, yet without
apparently affecting their mental power. But it was characteristic
of this minute and painstaking observer to accumulate
and set forth his results, unaffected by any apparent difficulties
or inconsistencies which they might seem to involve.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Important advances have been made in craniometry, as in
other branches of anthropology, since Dr. Morton formed the
collection which now, with many later additions, constitutes an
important department in the collections of the Academy of
Science of Philadelphia. Zealous and well-trained labourers
are following in his steps; but the value of his services to science
are more fully appreciated with every addition to the work he
inaugurated. Researches have been prosecuted for some years
by a committee of the British Association with a view to
securing reliable data relative to the tribes of the Canadian
North-West and British Columbia. In following out their
instructions, Dr. Franz Boas has prepared valuable tables of
measurements, both of living examples of the Haidah, Tsimshian,
Kwakintl, and Nootka tribes, and of crania of those and
other natives of the Pacific coast; but unfortunately he has
omitted the cerebral capacity. But a large collection of crania
of tribes lying to the south of British Columbia, now in the
Peabody Museum of Harvard University, has furnished to Mr.
Lucien Carr opportunities for a series of careful measurements
showing some very distinctive diversities among tribes of the
coast and the islands of Southern California. From those the
following table is derived. The capacity is given in cubic
centimetres; and shows not only a marked diversity in cerebral
capacity distinguishing different island tribes, but also notes
the relative difference of the male and female head. Among
the Indians of the Pacific coast are the Haidahs and others
noted for exceptional ingenuity and skill in their carvings,
pottery, and other handiwork. But besides the fair-skinned
Haidahs and Tsimshians of the north, there are essentially
diverse tribes of Southern California, noticeable for swarthy
and almost black colour; and not only inferior, but essentially
differing in the style of their arts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among exceptional features claimed as more or less a racial
characteristic of American crania, the <span class='it'>os Incæ</span>, or epactal
bone in the occiput, has been noted as present in various stages
of manifestation in 3.81 per cent; and among ancient
Peruvian crania in 6.08 per cent; while it does not apparently
exceed 2.65 per cent in the Negro; and only reaches
1.19 per cent in Europeans.<a id='r181'/><a href='#f181' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[181]</span></sup></a> In so far as this may be regarded
as a sign of arrested development, it is noteworthy as
thus occurring in excess in the small-headed, yet highly
ingenious and civilised Peruvian race. Dr. Morton noted as
a remarkable fact that the skull of the Peruvian child
appeared to equal in size that of other races; so that in a
much ampler sense than in the perpetuation of a suture of the
occiput beyond the stage of fœtal development, the small-sized
skull and brain of the adult Peruvian is abnormal. But he
followed out his observation of the phenomena no farther than
to state, in summing up his investigations “On the internal

<p class='pindent'>“The great American group,” he says, “is, in several
respects, well represented in the collection. It includes 490
crania and 13 casts, making a total of 503 from nearly 70
different nations and tribes. Of this large number 256
belong to the Toltecan race (embracing the semi-civilised
communities of Mexico, Bogota, and Peru), and 247 to the
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span>
barbarous tribes scattered over the continent. Of 164
measurements of crania of the barbarous tribes, the largest is
104 cubic inches; the smallest 69; and the mean of all 84.
One hundred and fifty-two Peruvian skulls give 101 cubic
inches for the largest internal capacity, 58 for the smallest,
and 75.3 for the average of all.”<a id='r183'/><a href='#f183' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[183]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The results which Professor Jeffreys Wyman arrived at
from a careful comparative measurement of the Squier collection,
were confirmed by his subsequent study of that of
Professor Agassiz, and may be quoted as applying to both;
for he sums up his later investigations with the remark:
“These results agree with all previous conclusions with regard
to the diminutive size of the ancient Peruvian brain.”<a id='r184'/><a href='#f184' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[184]</span></sup></a> Of
the Squier collection he says: “The average capacity of the
fifty-six crania measured agrees very closely with that indicated
by Morton and Meigs, namely, 1230 centimetres, or
75 cubic inches, which is considerably less than that of the
barbarous tribes of America, and almost exactly that of the
Australians and Hottentots as given by Morton and Meigs,
and smaller than that derived from a larger number of
measurements by Davis. Thus we have, in this particular,
a race which has established a complex civil and religious
polity, and made great progress in the useful and fine arts,—as
its pottery, textile fabrics, wrought metals, highways and
aqueducts, colossal architectural structures and court of almost
imperial splendour prove,—on the same level, as regards the
quantity of brain, with a race whose social and religious conditions
are among the most degraded exhibited by the human
race. All this goes to show, and cannot be too much insisted
upon, that the relative capacity of the skull is to be considered
merely as an anatomical and not as a physiological characteristic;
and unless the quality of the brain can be represented
at the same time as the quantity, brain measurement cannot
be assumed as an indication of the intellectual position of races
any more than of individuals.”<a id='r185'/><a href='#f185' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[185]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The only definite attempt of Dr. Morton to solve the difficulty
thus presented to us, curiously evades its true point.
“Something,” he says, “may be attributed to a primitive difference
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span>
of stock; but more, perhaps, to the contrasted activity of
the two races.” Here, however, it is not a case of intellectual
activity accompanied by, and seemingly begetting an increased
volume of brain; but only the assumption of greater activity
in the small-brained race to account for its triumph over
larger-brained barbarous tribes in the attainment of numerous
elements of a native-born civilisation. The question is, how
to account for this intellectual activity, with all its marvellous
results, attained by a race with an average brain of no greater
volume than that of the Bushman, the Australian, or other
lowest types of humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nilotic Egyptian race, of composite ethnical character,
presents striking elements of comparison, in the ingenious arts
and constructive skill of the ancient dwellers in the Nile
valley; but whether we take the Egyptian of the Catacombs,
the Copt, or the Fellah, we seek in vain for like microcephalous
characteristics. Among modern races the Chinese exhibit many
analogies in arts and social life to the ancient Peruvians; but
their cerebral capacity presents no correspondence to that of
the American race. Dr. Morton gives a mean capacity for the
Chinese skull of 85, as compared with the Peruvian 75.3,
while Dr. Davis derives from nineteen skulls a mean internal
capacity of 76.7 oz. av., or 93 cubic inches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But another Asiatic race, that of the Hindoos—also
associated with a remarkable ancient civilisation, and a social
and religious organisation not without suggestive analogies both
to ancient Egypt and Peru,—is noticeable for like microcephalous
characteristics. In completing the anatomical measurements
with which Dr. Morton closes his great work, he places
the Ethiopian lowest in the scale of internal capacity of
cranium; but, while including the Hindoo in his Caucasian
group, he adds: “It is proper to mention that but three
Hindoos are admitted in the whole number, because the skulls
of these people are probably smaller than those of any other
existing nation. For example, seventeen Hindoo heads give a
mean of but 75 cubic inches.”<a id='r186'/><a href='#f186' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[186]</span></sup></a> The Vedahs of Ceylon, the
Mincopies, the Negritos, and the Bushmen, appear to vie with
the Hindoos in smallness of skull; but all of them are races
of diminutive stature. This element, therefore, which has
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span>
been referred to as important in individual comparisons, is no
less necessary to be borne in view in determining such comparative
results as those which distinguish the Peruvians from
other American races. Certain races are unquestionably distinguished
from others by difference of stature. Barrow
determined the mean height of the Bushman, from measurements
of a whole tribe, to be 4 ft. 3½ in. D’Orbigny, from
nearly similar evidence, states that of the Patagonians to be
5 ft. 8 in. The internal capacity of the Peruvian skull, as
derived from eighteen male and six female Quichua skulls in
Dr. Davis’s collection, is 70, while he states that of the Patagonian
skull as 67 and of the Bushman as 65; but it is
manifest that the latter figures, if taken without reference to
relative stature, furnish a very partial index of the comparative
volume of brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Goodsir, as already noted, held that symmetry of
brain has more to do with the higher faculties than mere bulk.
In the case of the Peruvians the systematic distortion of the
skull precludes the application of this test. But in the small
Hindoo skull the fine proportions have been repeatedly noted.
Dr. Davis, in describing one of a Hindoo of unmixed blood,
born in Sumatra, says: “His pretty, diminutive skull is singularly
contrasted with those of the races by whom, alive, he
was surrounded”;<a id='r187'/><a href='#f187' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[187]</span></sup></a> and he adds: “The great agreement of
the elegant skulls of Hindoos in their types and proportions,
although not in dimensions, with those of European races, has
afforded some support to that widespread and learned illusion,
‘the Indo-European hypothesis.’ The Hindoo skulls are
generally beautiful models of form in miniature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Alfred R. Wallace, in his <span class='it'>Malay Archipelago</span>, discusses
the value of cranial measurements for ethnological purposes;
and, employing those furnished by Dr. J. B. Davis in his
<span class='it'>Thesaurus Craniorum</span> as a “means of determining whether the
forms and dimensions of the crania of the eastern races would
in any way support or refute his classification of them,” he
finally selected as the best tests for his purpose—1. The
capacity of the cranium; 2. The proportion of the width to
the length taken as 100; 3. The proportion of the height to
the length taken as 100. But here again, unfortunately, the
<span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>
systematic distortion of the Peruvian skull limits us to the
first of those tests. There are, indeed, the eleven normal
Peruvian crania selected as such from the numerous Ancon
skulls brought by Professor Agassiz from Peru. But those
are stated by Professor Wyman to be on an average less by
six inches than the ordinary skull. Some partial results embodied
in the following table admit of comparison with those
based on the more ample data of <a href='#table10'>Table X.</a> Dr. Lucae, in his
<span class='it'>Zur Organischen Formenlehre</span>, gives the cranial capacity of
single skulls of different races, selected as examples of each.
In these, as in others already referred to, the capacity was
determined with peas; and the results—assumed to be given
in Prussian ounces,—are dealt with here, as in the skulls of
Heinse and Bünger. The experiments carried on for the purpose
of testing the process fully confirmed the results stated
by Professor Wyman as to the differences in apparent cubical
capacity according to the material employed. Taking a sound
Huron Indian skull, a mean internal capacity of 1490 grms.
was obtained by repeatedly gauging it with peas, and of
1439.5 with rice. The position of the Negro, heading the
list, serves to show the exceptional nature of the evidence;
though this is rather due to the inferiority of other examples,
such as the Chinese and Greenlander, than to its capacity
greatly exceeding the Negro mean. In the first column the
unzen, as Prussian ounces, are rendered in grammes. The
second column gives the nearer approximation to the true
specific gravity, according to the standard referred to, based
on a series of experiments carried out under my direction in
the laboratory of the University of Toronto, and assuming
82.5 grms. of peas to occupy the space of 100 grms. of water.
The third and fourth columns represent the estimated brain-weight,
after the requisite deductions, on the basis of s.g. of
brain as 1.0408.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the following table the examples are derived from Dr.
J. B. Davis’s tables, with the exception of the Peruvians. For
these I have availed myself of Dr. Jeffreys Wyman’s careful
observations on the large collection in the Peabody Museum,
the results of which confirm Dr. Morton’s earlier data. One
further fact, however, may be noted as a result of my own
study of Peruvian crania, amply confirmed by the published
observations of others, namely, that while the Peruvian head unquestionably
ranks among those of the microcephalous races,
the range of variation among the Peruvian coast tribes appears
to be less than that even of the Australian. Of this there is
good evidence, based on the comparison of several hundred
crania. But exceptional examples of unusually large skulls
may be looked for in all races; and a few of such abnormal
Peruvian or other skulls would modify the mean capacities
and weights in the following table. Nevertheless the average
results, as a whole, are probably a close approximation to the
truth:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking for some definite results from the various data
here produced, the deductions which they seem to suggest
may be thus stated. While Professor Wyman justly remarks
that the relative capacity of the skull, and consequently of the
encephalon, is to be considered as an anatomical and not as a
physiological characteristic, relative largeness of the brain is
nevertheless one of the most distinguishing attributes of man.
Ample cerebral development is the general accompaniment
of intellectual capacity, alike in individuals and races; and
microcephaly, when it passes below well-defined limits, is no
longer compatible with rational intelligence; though it amply
suffices for the requirements of the highest anthropomorpha.
Wagner thus definitely refers the special characteristics which
separate man from the irrational creation to one member of
the encephalon: “The relation of the lobes of the cerebrum
to intelligence may, perhaps, be expressed thus: there is a
certain development of the mass of the cerebrum, especially
of the convolutions, requisite in order to such a development
of intelligence as divides man from other animals.”
<span class='pageno' title='402' id='Page_402'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The important data accumulated by Morton, Meigs, Davis,
Tiedemann, Pruner-Bey, Broca, and others, by the process of
gauging the skulls of different races, proceeds on the assumption
of brain of a uniform density. But it seems by no means
improbable that certain marked distinctions in races may be
traceable to the very fact of a prevailing difference in the
specific gravity of the brain, or of certain of its constituent
portions; to the greater or less complexity of its convolutions;
and to the relative characteristics of the two hemispheres.
Moreover, it may be that some of those sources of difference in
races may not lie wholly out of our reach, or even beyond our
control. The diversity of food, for example, of the Peruvians
and of the American Indian hunter tribes was little less than
that which distinguishes the Eskimo from the Hindoo, or the
nomad Tartar from the Chinese. The remarkable cerebral
capacity characteristic of the Oceanic races is the accompaniment
of well-defined peculiarities in food, climate, and other
physical conditions; and Australia is even more distinct in its
physical specialties than in its variety of race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking then to the unwonted persistency of the Peruvian
cranium within such narrow limits, so far at least as the
physical characteristics of the predominant population of Peru
are illustrated by means of the great Coast cemeteries; and to
the striking discrepancy between the volume of brain and the
intellectual activity of the race; I am led to the conclusion
that, in the remarkable exceptional characteristics thus established
by the study of this class of Peruvian crania, we have
as marked an indication of a distinctive race-character as anything
hitherto noted in anthropology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The use of different standards of weights and measures, and of diverse
materials for determining the capacity of the skull in different countries, greatly
complicates the researches of the craniologist. Some pains have been taken here
to bring the various weights and measurements to a common standard. In
attempting to do so in reference to the weight of brain of Italy’s great poet, the
following process was adopted: It was ascertained by experiment that 912.5 grms.
of rice, well shaken down, occupied the space of 1000 grms. of water. Hence
3.1321 lbs. rice&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.4324 water. Multiplying this by 1.04, the s.g. of brain, the
result is the capacity of the skull, viz. 3.5697 lbs., or 57 oz., as given above.
In this and other investigations embodied in the present paper, I was indebted to
the valuable co-operation of my late friend and colleague, Professor H. H. Croft.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
